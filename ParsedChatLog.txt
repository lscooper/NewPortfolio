Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And I'm sure you could guess much better than I regarding anything Arthas did. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: aw
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i couldn't remember if you could do this immediately or not 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm not convinced there's some deeper meaning to Arthas releasing Arla to me. He was just one little whelp, after all. Arthas could afford to be a little indulgent about it, I think. Arla seems convinced that there was some higher power at work, though. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Maybe he just liked you. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That's more or less what I suspected. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm surprised you'd give Arthas so much credit as to presume he'd be capable of such things, Kelahnias...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: He always did try to reward his most capable servants. He liked you as much as a monster could, I'd imagine, especially because you saved him so much effort. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm going to choose to take that as a compliment.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And besides, it's so much easier to control a willing servant. Might as well throw him a bone once in a while, and it's not like one little drake would make any difference. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will remind you that Arthas quite literally kicked wolves off my still-warm corpse. He gave me a lab to work in, support on my more ambitious projects, and most importantly, he-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, that's none of your business.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Hm. He said 'jump' and you said 'how high.' That's nothing new, and I'm sure you weren't the only one he used in such a manner. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: An alchemist of your talent is surely worth kicking a few wolves. Don't think you were special beyond what you could do for him. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He actually cared when I got back from my trips, Kelahnias. He didn't just say, "Oh, that's nice, now go away again." Maybe that wasn't anything special. But it fucking was to me.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: How touching. Killing him was special to me, but we all have our differences. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: He cared about you so much, to strip you of your free will alongside all the rest of us. You got a few perks because you were easy.  
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And that was different from your current arrangement with Bolvar.... how?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: OH GOD
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: (FUCK(
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Bolvar is a means to an end that will be dealt with as soon as the Legion's gone. And I'm certainly not sitting here planning on how to kill everything on Azeroth.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I wonder if he'd use the same words to describe you, Deathlord.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Just means to an end.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Bolvar isn't killing families in the streets. Bolvar isn't poisoning fucking grain supplies. Arthas didn't even need to be the Lich King to murder an entire city. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Listen, I understand that you have not had the advantage of my extensive education on the operation of demons. What, will you hold Arthas responsible for the crimes committed by Teron Gorefiend? He was the first, you know. The Lich King is a unique entity
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Get yourself into this kind of situation again, I don't care, Deathlord. But Arla and I talk fairly regularly. I... hear things about what you've been up to recently. Not that it's hard to guess, with the brand new undead drakes your people have.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I will hold Arthas responsible for his actions just as I expect to be held responsible for mine. People make choices, Heartbinder.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I don't fool myself with delusions of being the good guy. I never have. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But if you carry on this way, I'd appreciate you getting off your high, winged horse.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I have done what I've had to to protect Azeroth. When I start murdering children in their homes, then by all means, put a stop to it. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'll hold you to that, Deathlord. If it comes to the choice between those children dying by your hand or becoming slaves to the Legion... I wonder, what would you choose?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I do not dwell in hypotheticals. If it comes to that, I suppose you'll have your answer. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Though if I've got time to be killing children instead of the demons attacking them, I've failed on far too many accounts already. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A well executed dodge of my question.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Your question is idiotic. Just because you wish to find as many ways to twist my words as possible doesn't make you clever. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hm. Alright, alright, I won't ask again.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You've already told me what I wanted to know, anyway.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Which is?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I think you already know what your answer would be, and it frightens you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You belittle me, yet your answer is as much a deflection as mine was. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You don't know a thing about me, you just enjoy your games. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It doesn't take a genius to tell that you're not nearly as self-assured as you sound
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: (i guess it's just been a really long time since i sold shit
Nordaras. The start of the end of the world. And you're here to see it off...
Nordaras, necromancer.
Nordaras.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Self-assurance has nothing to do with it, and I am *not* frightened. I do not shy away from my actions, or their consequences. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, you've certainly got me convinced. Very convinced. This is my "convinced" voice.
Nordaras says: Delivered as promised, Torp!
Nordaras says: Delivered as promised, Torp!
Nordaras says: Door-to-door kodo delivery!
Nordaras says: The Scourge are no match for me, Torp!
Nordaras says: Here's your kodo, Torp!
Nordaras says: The Scourge are no match for me, Torp!
Nordaras says: Delivered as promised, Torp!
Nordaras says: Here's your kodo, Torp!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Look, as much as I adore arguing with a defensive brick wall, I would really rather talk about... literally anything else. The weather. The latest Hearthstone tournament. What types of underpants you think the leaders of the Horde wear.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Sylvanas, of course, is obvious, because she seems to wear only underpants.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: --Ah, what was I saying?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Hypothesizing about Sylvanas' underwear? Or lack thereof. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That was mostly-- You don't get credit for guessing what she goes for because it's obvious, is all I'm saying.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I guess your.. phrasing threw me off, is all. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Besides, you can make the same argument for Vol'jin, I think.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Or maybe he doesn't count anymore.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, unless there's something you need to tell me about the Horde's... illustrious former leader, I'm pretty sure he doesn't count any more.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Actually, Garrosh falls into that category as well, doesn't he?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm not sure we could pull off something like that and keep it a secret, so nothing to worry about there. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: What is *wrong* with the Horde...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: The Horde has managed to put Sylvanas Windrunner in charge of their entire organization.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That should be the only proof you need as to what's wrong. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hmm. I can't say I'm particularly fond of the woman, myself.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That's the first sensible thing you've said all day. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: She's a hypocrite. If she'd just come out and admit that she's really no different from the Scourge, that would be one thing.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: As it stands, she likes to paint herself as some... heroic martyr, making the hard sacrifices to do... something. And her aesthetic is horrible, and the plague is just... so inelegant.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: It's incredible how quickly you go from saying something reasonable to... not. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Not that you're wrong. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But her "inelegance" is certainly not what concerns me.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And her similarities to the Scourge are more concerning than you'll admit. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: The lack of elegance is something I had words with Arthas about on several occasions. Those ridiculous floating fortresses with those stupid skulls on the outside....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I am certainly concerned about what she's up to, believe me. I also think she's an incompetent hypocrite who enjoys aggravating people she shouldn't.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: A monster isn't less horrifying just because they're more *elegant* about it. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...Less of an eyesore, though.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Obviously*, it would be better if it wasn't there at all, but there's no reason it should mess up the view if it is there.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And you see no problem with their other methods? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Arthas and Sylvanas both have stripped people of their lives with the purpose of shaping them into tools. I cannot understand how that wouldn't be the most obvious problem. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Now? Obviously. But I also see the corruption of the Legion. You see only the symptoms. You forget that all of this- the plague, the Lich King, the helm, Frostmourne- it was the work of demons, first. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I do not *forget.* We're fighting the Legion, just as we fought the Scourge. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But please, enlighten me as to how you can see corruption that somehow the rest of us are missing. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Because I was in Val'sharah. I've seen the demon hunters that are too far gone. I've seen the Legion corrupt just as the Scourge did, and I'm trying to stop it. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I do live here too, you know.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I had a relatively pleasant time in service to Arthas. I will not deny that. And nobody can deny that he was effective at what he did. And, hell, I will admit freely to missing him, as a person. I miss the man that was hiding under that helmet.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But if you think for one second that I will not fight the Legion until there is nothing left in me...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Then I think you're getting ahead of yourself. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Think as lowly of me as you wish, Deathlord. It won't stop me from giving everything I have to stop the Legion, because Azeroth is my fucking home, too.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... I will give you the credit you deserve, Heartbinder, that's a rousing speech. I don't know if your actions will follow your words, but if they do, then we will save Azeroth, or we will die trying side by side.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But forgive me if most of the time it's hard to tell whether or not you actually care. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, well, that is an issue that I had long before I died, if you'd believe it. The echo... doesn't help matters, does it.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... No, I would think not. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: If you insist on still thinking of me as an inherently selfish man, which I will not deny, then perhaps you would have an easier time stomaching my motivations if I told you that, as a warlock, I'm likely to meet a particularly grisly end if the Legion
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: gets their hands on me. Subjugating their people, and all that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Charnagma tolerates me, because he likes the cats. Everyone else... takes poorly to it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...he hates when I do that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...they snuck up on me
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh, dear
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I almost asked you to hold still.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ughhh... there's eggs in this pool
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I... can't use path of frost here???
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I've always wondered how insects manage to build such elaborate, gorgeous architecture.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Their grasp of tools and mathematics and even simple aesthetics seems like it would be so... rudimentary, at best.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You know I'm... sure you'll find this hard to believe, Nordaras, but I don't enjoy seeing the worst in people. If you say you wish to help save Azeroth, I'd like to believe it's not for purely selfish reasons. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, we never exactly saw them at their best.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm not sure I'd want to...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I hate it when the cats bring in spiders as it is.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Not a lot to feast on, guys.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: It's the thought that counts, I guess.
Kelahnias pokes Charnagma.  Hey!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I wouldn't if I were you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He gets.... testy, sometimes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Especially when recently summoned.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I think he goes to take naps when he gets sent away, although I've never been sure.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I was just.. curious if he had any substance to him. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He certainly does when he hits things, that's for certain.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, so do ghosts
Nordaras-ArgentDawn nervously pats Indy.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Don't worry, I've never seen her really bite. Mostly just kind of... tug.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: She's only got one fang, anyways. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...Where did the other one even go?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm assuming it never grew in.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: let me know when you get close and i'll pop on up to the top
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: will do
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.. have arrived 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: cool my disguise is failing gimme a sec
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh no, you've been revealed as... a slightly different zombie
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: just a normal ghoul with fire around his head
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: make sure you, uh, actually pick his head up off the ground 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i definitely didn't make that mistake as elivan no sir
Kelahnias scowls at The Lich King.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: heyyy look at this idiot
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: nordaras' lil wave 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: me?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ouch
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: :(
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okay see you later 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: honestly the keyblades look more like frostmourne than the artifact does 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just like.. shape-wise
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they really do
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: give em the cool skull hilt thing and they'd be Good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: honestly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ghhhghg i dont wanna do the argent crusade shit here wah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nordaras can definitely survive in a level 77 zone now right
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they will Definitely give me quests, right
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: uh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nah there's no way they'd give me stuff from 3 levels too low
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this one draenei at ebon watch has a sweet fuckin sword
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: zoe bough legion and made a demon hunter who is a Party Girl 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: bought
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh hell yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was about to ask who that was
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yee i always feel bad just randomly inviting people to the guild 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: demon hunters just seem like a very Her aesthetic so i hope she has fun with them 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: theyre very fun
Kelahnias to join your group.
Kelahnias joins the party.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: which ones did you wanna run?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im at violet citadel and its the highest one i can get quests from
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: alrighty be there momentarily 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this is a good dungeon for me to be useless in
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm imagining all these big and awful creatures in here and then one lone, very angry blood elf mage 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: she's scarier than any of them
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea and aethas, the scariest people in here
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean you're absolutely right 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's disgusting
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i was trying to figure out why my auto attacks keep aoe-ing the whole group and i think it's this Claw of the Crystalline Scorpid
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im always forgetting to put my mog back to normal once i get out of the trial of style
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: convenient, i guess
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: purple shards don't really fit my aesthetic though :/
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: chimichanga is cooler than this fucko
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: nordaras rolls up looking like a clown like '... i can explain'
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: chimichanga is cooler than many fuckos
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the tiny, fast-paced 'pap paps' of indy's little feet are so important to me 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: god the sounds of ur little pets running behind you are so good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bitch
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so i can get inside literally any dungeon at this point but let me check which ones i can get quests from
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i know the three icc ones are too high level for me to get quests
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: unfortunate
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can get quests from gundrak and halls of stone
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: whichever one you wanna do 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can also get quests from drak'tharon keep
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: let's do drak'tharon and then gundrak
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bc if i can get close to 77 before we go for halls of stone, then i'll be able to that and stone of lightning one after another
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: gotcha
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh i can also give you a transmogrifier if you want one 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yeah he could probably use that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this isn't a bad outfit, but, yknow, it's not him
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it looks very mage-y 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: god i love that you just sit on the pillow 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wish i had better staves to use but im too low of level rip in pieces me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank u for the yak
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: anytime :0 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: also i definitely clicked gundrak instead of drak'theron whoops guess i'll be getting off at the next flight master 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: once i get high enough level i'm gonna spend a lot of time running serpentshrine cavern bc the warlock set from there is so gorgeous and i guess they changed it to be soloable
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: y'know i've Never run that raid before
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: me neither i just think the set is neat
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hood of the CorruptorMantle of the CorruptorRobe of the CorruptorGloves of the Corruptor
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Cord of Screaming TerrorsLeggings of the CorruptorBoots of the Shifting Nightmare
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh spooky 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im not fully sold on the headgear but god it's cool
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: god i fly over and there's just scourged trolls running around Everywhere
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this interior is super cool looking
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: "too many of them" i mean, alright
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: two elves, a ghost, two pets, and a voidlord
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess that's what "too many" means
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: y
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, yes, they should be very terrified of my small little ghost dog
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: u
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: GODDAMMIT that enter key
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's... a sword
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i like wolves much more when they're puppies and also ghosts and unable to hurt me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: holy shit
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... you're making progress, at least 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aw, fuck, spiders
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but i'll have you know she's a fearsome ankle-biter when she wants to be 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ghh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: surely
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's a poor excuse for a death knight 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aw damn i didnt dunk the cloth in the lich
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry What 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i get that it's a quest but 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's what you do!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: use the cloth on the dead lich
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: motherfucker 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there he is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess arthas didn't like that dude we killed downstairs
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: man wouldn't i t be wild if i ever did these quests in order 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, y'know, 
Kelahnias threatens The Lich King with the wrath of doom.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okay so it turns out that you like, grow 10 feet when you're dead and shit
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not only did i not get wings, i'm also the same size. fuck you arthas 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i like that when arthas stabs frostmourne in the ground he struggles a little to get it back out
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he's gonne ruin it if he keeps doing that!!
Kelahnias creates: Healthstone.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... unfortunate
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess we uh.... looted him too quick
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we can always go outside and run it again
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we only need to get to this boss anyway
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ye
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but also, uh, if we've learned Anything it's that the lich king isn't above sacrificing his own people
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: only if u fuck up
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: like, if u fuck up real bad, like not catching some living idiots infiltrating
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... or if he wants to try and take a swipe at tirion fordring
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that's personal
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do get another 51k xp if we finish the dungeon all the way
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ooh nice 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hold on i need to put my fan on my laptop
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's gettin Toasty
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okey dokey
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: god i almost melted my chapstick with my laptop
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: god rip
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess it's a good thing for nordaras that he's a generally competent dude
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that would be a bad day for him
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's just gross
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's some very inappropriate comments i could make right now but i will contain myself
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: thanks
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: honestly taking samples from other liches is absolutely within the realm of shit nordaras would do
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, you know
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: they do seem to be dropping like flies these days
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: might as well study them
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's how i got this lovely little cat
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: muradin's... lost.... greaves
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: how did this thing end up with muradin's pants
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how do you lose your pants to an undead snake thing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, was he playing poker with it?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he must be a very shitty poker player
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: maybe if i bring him his pants back we can swap stories
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he seems like such a fascinating man
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not sure he'd want to chat with you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's why i would bring him his pants
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you make a good point
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the titans aren't exactly my area of expertise but they're certainly quite interesting
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright we should be right on track for lightning and stone once we do gundrak
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: nice
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm i really dont have any flight points that far north
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: unfortunate
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i can fly you if you want 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yeah that would be lovely
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: my furthest north is argent stand lmao
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ghhh i gotta remember where the entrance to the gundrak dungeon is because it's... weird
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: like in some building off to the side
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it took me forever to find it the first time
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank u
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sure sure
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sorry i keep like, leaning back against my bed bc my back is Dying
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know why the grizzly hills music is still playing but i appreciate it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're fine :0
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yaaaay
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ur still a dragon
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i sure am
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: wild
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you have to love that in times like these people still seem to think it's a good idea to betray one another
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that is a lot of snakes
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the amount of snakes here is frankly unnecessary
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooh, bones and snakes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: definitely not an upgrade
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: how creative
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: these were some very large creatures
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i just don't understand how you get a normal troll to look like that 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the same way you get a human man to be approximately 15 feet tall and 5 feet wide, probably
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... you've got a point
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't.. know where that passage is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you know, i feel a lot better about the whole kael'thas thing
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... how's that?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: knowing that these people literally killed their gods and drank their blood in reaction to the scourge
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you've.. got a point
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: this makes kael'thas seem downright reasonable
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: which is quite the accomplishment
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: though i guess we have to consider the fact that the drakkari appear to have been... actually successful in fending off the scourge
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: at least at the moment
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes, but clearly, if the two of us had ever been dispatched, they would no longer bue successful
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *be
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: based solely on current circumstances
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i killed one guy, i'm helping
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, apparently arthas decided i wasn't usefull enough to keep around, so here we are
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you... did sort of leave
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm cautiously optimistic that if we run the dungeons i just unlocked it'll get me to 78 and then i can do the icecrown ones
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not entirely sure leaving is the right word, but sure
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that would be Great
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: why is the quest marker.... down
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think he moves to the end,,
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: goddammit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if nordaras wasNT SO SLOW
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: listen he doesn't have a lot of musclemass
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: halls of stone and lightning are up by ulduar, right?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think so
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: cool
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: y'know, thinking about it, i'm sure the rest of the scourge has No Idea what actually happened at the battle of light's hope adhjflk 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: arthas comes back in the worst mood imaginable without an entire floating city and a ton of people
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: "dude what Happened"
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: "i dont wanna talk about it.... SOMEONE FOLLOW ME, I'M DISTRAUGHT"
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: jdkhjfa that's a very arthas thing to do
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this is why nordaras has job security
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: god ulduar is so pretty even on super low graphics
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he dared to follow arthas to hear about how he was feeling when no one else would
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but with everying cranked up it's so fucking gorgeous
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: honestly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: "do u want a backrub and some wine" "i can't get drunk but yes"
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: alright i found the halls of lightning 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: coolio
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: listen sometimes it's the thought that counts
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: found the other one 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: lets do the other one first
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bc it's lower level so i dont wanna outlevel it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: which is unlikely but yknow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: deprecating xp
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yep
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: arthas: 'yeah all those death knights are Traitors and they're awful and i hate them' 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: 'you tried to sacrifice us and then got mad when we survived and regained out free will but okay' 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: "just cause i took their free will and set them loose to slaughter everything :/"
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: our
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: "they should be Grateful"
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: can we get this giant
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank u
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ow my ankles
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: stop whining, you can fix them
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's nothing compared to the time slackjaw--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im gonna grab brann
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's like having an expert tour guide this is the best
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think this is the lazer room
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nordaras is visibly vibrating with excitement
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... shoulda brought thal
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: she's just crying at me
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think that's a normal reaction to have to you 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: shoutout to soul leech
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: welp
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: are you... doing okay over there?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: OW
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm fine but i'm on fire
Nordaras-ArgentDawn listens raptly.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry a what
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the curse of flesh? wild
Kelahnias lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, today has been a good day
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's fascinating!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: old gods imprisoned below our very feet...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that can't be good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it generally isn't 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but it definitely is fascinating!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm... glad you're having fun
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: plus, the chance to walk through titan halls...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: metal vrykul!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn:  deathlord, the implications of this are... astounding!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...i want to kill it and see what it looks like inside
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .. i'm not sure i see what the big deal is
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: of course you do
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have missed this kind of thing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: exploring hostile ruins always just makes my day
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm... glad? it's good to have hobbies 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and such discoveries! if it still worked, by heart would be pounding with sheer excitement
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: let's go fight the titans
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh i desperately need to sell
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: this is certainly something thalanor would enjoy more than i but.. someone needs to keep an eye on you before you go waking up an old god or something
Kelahnias receives item: Pathfinder's Saddle.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would never
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: certainly not intentionally, at least
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you will be happy to hear that i do not hold with meddling with some forces
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and old gods are definitely included in that list
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's fantastic news 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: still, try not to touch anything that could end azeroth 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i will do my best
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... how do hunks of metal that get churned out from some sort of forge have.. families?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think he was speaking metaphorically
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but he had a signet ring and everything!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: these things became vrykul which then became humans, they... have to have the same basic components
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but they're.. rocks
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... and why are they trying to kill us? aren't we technically on the same side?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we're abberations to them
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ....... why?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not because of the undeath thing, mind you, but i think just because we... Aren't made of rocks
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we aren't part of the plan
Kelahnias lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that makes.. no sense, but alright
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they created their children to do a specific set of things, but the old gods put a stop to that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and they don't like it
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but we don't like the old gods 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: either that, or this loken guy is just a massive douche
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so somehow both the old gods and the titans hate us
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we didn't even DO anything
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: much like how you don't like arthas, but still owe your existence in this form to him
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that is not the same thing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's a metaphor, buddy
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's not a very good one
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: since this seems to be difficult for you to grasp
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hey guess who can now run.... culling of stratholme
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh HELL yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh he's gonna explain why he hates us i guess
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, great 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh i guess he is just a dick
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: uh,
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: what the fuck
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you know i feel like we should prioritize the old godd about to be released above the other shit here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: why do you suppose he said his death heralds the end of the world
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the old god wouldn't be a problem if these dicks weren't around trying to release him
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he's a narcisstic asshole? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's probably it
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he also said we couldn't kill him and look where that got him
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do we wanna go do stratholme?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you're absolutely right
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oooh yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright i
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ll hearth and use the portal
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: there are... so many people who seem to say they can't be killed right before we, you know, kill them
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it does seem common
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: does it ever bother you to think about the fact that the time dragons know exactly what we might do in the future?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this is demeaning
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: my god
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias with the wrath of doom.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: kill me again
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, absolutely not 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the pink hair is a great touch
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i hate this
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: aw but now i'm imagining nordaras getting to look like his whole self, minus all the wolf bites and all
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's like inverted of most elves
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he had weird fel warlock green eyes 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and then he died and now he has blue
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, you know 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he has a whole face finally
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it makes him unique
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think that's way too timeline breaking for arthas tho
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it would be. a lot
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't want him seeing me like this, i'm hideous
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: perfect
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sometimes we have to make things work
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: subtle
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that horse is Very on fire
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I DIDNT REALIZE I HAD THIS FUCKING THING
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: your horse is dead and has wings
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah it's the warlock horse hadjksfh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sure does
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im a tiny hideous man 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the bit of bare arm is a nice touch
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and his nerd book on his armor...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what was that i was saying about demons being to fault for... pretty much everything?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i will die very quickly in th middle of this shit
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: OH NO
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's 100% my bad
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i might go sit by arthas where im definitely safe
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i was watching
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: uh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: this guy was sitting down and having drinks and then the other guy turned into a zombie
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it was very distracting
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: wait a minute
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're not a gnome anymore
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: stop flirting with him
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nope i put on the orb so i can take screenshots
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: OH okay
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sure wish i had that gotdang orb
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im not that crass, kel, he just got his heart broken
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oddly enough deciding to purge an enitre city can put a strain on your relationship;
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: also im safe back here he's very good at killing things
Kelahnias begins to groan.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i did that just to annoy kel
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and also bc the orb is wearing off
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: come on, buddy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: a textbook example of how the legion can play anyone like a fiddle if they put their minds to it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i probably have time for one more dungeon before i have dnd
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: wanna do one of the icecrown ones?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we can try but in theory they have an requirement for your gear
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh wild
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: uh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what's up?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: where u goin
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: are you still on me??
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's absolutely wild
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it was loading icecrown for the first time so i might have stuttered out of existence
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you straight up disappeared on my screen
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm assuming it's because wrathgate is instance 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's wild
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: instanced 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i was def still on u
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: god im almost 79 i wonder if these three dungeons will put me over
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ooh that'd be neat
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: also afk a second my mom wants something 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okey dokey
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: guess who Finally got their AP refund check from senior year of highschool ahdfjk
Kelahnias waves at Ebon Blade Commander.
Kelahnias gently pats Mr. Bigglesworth.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: holy shit amazing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: let me take some pain meds real quick bc i realized im hurting so bad bc they've... worn off....
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: god yeah that'll do it 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: time to crank up the music
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's time to fuckin rock out
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nordaras definitely knows how to get in there if u know what i mean
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: :|
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bronjahm is JAHMING OUT
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: god apparently
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was listening closely and the bass line of this part started right when we got into combat with him
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's honestly incredible
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: god the fact that taliesin voices this thing frightens me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: god whatever these things are, illidan had one too
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh fuck
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i leveled up though
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: OH SHIT
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: uh... lemme put your soul back in your body real quick
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i had a debuff i think i was taking his damage too
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thanks
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh that would. definitely end poorly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: "it is there that arthas lets his guard down..." he is NAPPING, sylvanas
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: kel, accidentally dealing like 2 millions points of damange to nordaras,
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: """accidentally"""
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sometimes these things happen
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i really like this music too
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the melody of this piece is just so haunting
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i love it So much
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright also i gotta go free boys
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sylvanas is so unconcerned about her people dying
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm gonna try just. rounding up the enemies
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: does that... shock you?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: NOPE
Nordaras sets 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bad
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this orc lady is still fighting tho holy shit
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i respect it 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright i have all the slaves freed i need to
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this guy died over where sylvanas is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or the guy to turn in to
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sure did
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright im good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: could sylvanas stop referring to herself in the third person
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... arthas really couldn't find any better death knights, huh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the only explanation for arthas leaving frostmourne while under attack is that he was taking a nap
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hi, mr krabs
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think he lost all the good ones
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: unfortunate for him
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: every time u kill someone i get 2,888 xp
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it is Insane
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's incredible
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im at 57% already
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... right
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there it is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i highly doubt there's anything in there for you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i actually don't know which of these two i like less
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...well
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn sips tea. Ooh, the tea is hot.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hey babe
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you sure did get dressed quick
Kelahnias covers his face with his palm.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's grumpy when he first wakes up
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... he's ALWAYS grumpy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he takes a lot of naps
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: marwyn's flavor text is so sad :(
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: IT SURE IS
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: here lemme put frostmourne back on the pedastal thingy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im nappin here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's not that comfy
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: shocking
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they're not even real skulls
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he bought them on a post-halloween sale
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i shoulda taken the thing that lets me be on fire and faster
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im good here
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: get down from there
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sorry to run out on you like this
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's so goddamn far away a;ffskfls
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he should really put a little pep in his step
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he had a bad nap and now he's all groggy 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im going to be EASILY level 80 once we finish this dungeon
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: nice
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this is... absolutely the way to do shit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: heirlooms and dungeons

Nordaras-ArgentDawn: dragon last

Nordaras-ArgentDawn: also i am getting decent xp from these guys, and it'll be a lot of it so that's good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh no im outside
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm yeah these guys do not give Tons of Xp
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: elivan i think we might need to fight this man
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the titans are nearly as big of dicks as the old gods
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i should have smacked him earlier dammit it did the thing again
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nah u cant even trade it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh my god those shoulderpads are csu themed
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: god no save me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oddly enough some of these mobs give more xp than bosses
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: THOSE WORMS CAME FOR ME
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: u kno u can click my icon on the side 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: OH
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wild
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh no
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh shit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can avoid that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: its my turn hold up
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: soMETHING BLEW UP
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: cool i'll chill

Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think it broke
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think i also broke
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this is fine
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: can u get me or should i release
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: foolish
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: YOU GOT THEM
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: CATS
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i released on instinct rip

Nordaras-ArgentDawn: my gloves are broken
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aight we want freya
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it is like... unbearably hot in this apartment  holy shit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: probably bc im hunched over this toasty computer but yknow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: u are very glowy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i sure wish there was headgear that gave u blue glowy eyes but alas
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: elivan, i see a big red dangerous button in our future
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i am Going To Press It
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: look at it, elivan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so big.... so red..... so shiny.....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it says not to push it!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i must do it!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you might have been correct
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but that just adds to the fun
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: exploring titan architecture with an old god beneath our feet? fighting our way through it??? talking to a titan emisarry? this is thrilling!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and scientifically so significant
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not to mention culturally
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it is THE BEST
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: see, it's fine!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how can you not be excited? we're going to go and fight an old god!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i rarely find fights so invigorating in the ruins i frequent
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: perhaps i should spend more time with titans, if they're always this fun
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't deny their awfulness, elivan, but the chance to see one in person? to fight one?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what could be more exciting than to kill a god?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i accidentally disabled chatlogs
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but it also didnt have the last bit??
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh shit yeah i sort of combines all of them
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well i can type up the missing bits
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you need to learn to live a little bit, elivan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and that's coming from a dead man
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i survived all the ruins, all the demons, all the everything
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you know what got me?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i went to pick herbs too late at night
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and got eaten by wolves
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, it was
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: lots of blood
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but the point is, it's when you're in the most danger that you're the safest
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and when you think that you're safe that you're in the most danger
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: to quote a classic work of fiction: you aren't in control if you aren't out of control
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yeah, but it's sure fun
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i dated arthas for a while
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i dont think the worst it can throw at me will be that bad
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: at least, by my standards
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's a very handsome man, elivan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: charming, when he wants to be
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or, wanted to be
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im sure serving the old gods would be fine for me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh wow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: cool i'll chill
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you can do it, elivan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: u need to go inside him and kill his brain
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and u can hit the tentacles when they grab you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: also dnd is done so we can do icc
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: for some high quality kel and nordaras screaming if u want
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess elivan can come too but i figure kel does better damage
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: keelah might come too, so nordaras will be very outnumbered
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, aside from my unfortunate runin with a faceless one, i think that went alright
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: elivan. Elivan. look at me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you killed an old god using a weapon of their own design
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you looked into the eyes of mind-boggling power and destroyed it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: good gods, you need to stop being so hard on yourself. you're more powerful than you give yourself credit for, and just because some people fear that power, it doesn't mean you need to sell yourself so short
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: kids these days and their self esteem...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright u wanna switch over and get this shit going
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: power is how you help people
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if you're powerless, it doesn't matter how much you want to save azeroth, because people will power will you stop you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *with
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's so good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yeee
Kelahnias to join your group.
Kelahnias joins the party.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and it's very good because the glow is really hard to notice on the normal blood elf model but in shadowform it just looks.. neat 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im gonna take a quick detour on my way bc i want to take a screenshot that will hopefully look as good as i want it too
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's v noticable in shadowform
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aw fuck it's cloudy here :/
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: aw no
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: w
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wanted a screenshot with icc, dalaran, and argus in it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but u cant even See It Here
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's Lame 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he's Fashionable, slimjim
Kelahnias with a hearty hello!
Kelahnias nods at you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: gentlemen,
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no point doing it in easy mode
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i regret this already
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm sure it will go swimmingly 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: garrosh hellscream. fuck you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: all i want is to kill that fraud
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and his tasteless pets
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: harsh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hey, uh, would you be willing to let me look up how to do this quest of mine
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: since i have you gentlemen here 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yeh go for it!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i dunno if it needs to be heroic 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: try not to kill the boss yet i'll be right back
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: since i will be, you know, taking approximately 400 screenshots of nordaras with arthas once we get up there
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: GOD it's wild 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn nervously pets Indy.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so we don't have to be in heroic but we also have to make sure we don't. kill her instantly 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's gonna be.. a pain
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the cult lady?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the blood queen
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: strip down fuckos
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nordaras is fine he's a baby
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: also i left my axe in the bank i'll, uh, be right back assuming you lads are up for helping 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: might as well do it while we're here yknow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: effeciency
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: which you don't have to be it's gonna be... weird especially since we're just huge meatshields 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'll link the wowhead page if you want.. a vague idea of what we're doing 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okey
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: basically i'm gonna turn into a vampire and bite you guys 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and you shame *me* for being a dick? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...aaand he's gone
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hello.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: would you like to pet the cat
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: fascinating axe you have there
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was trying to look at it, but okay
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would ask where you got it from but, ah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it looks... hungry
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you know
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: kelahnias! always a pleasure to see you. please stand between me and this friend of yours. that would be great
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not off to a great start, then?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, we can go
Kelahnias laughs.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not particularly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, this works too
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we were discussing his cool weapon
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's certainly something
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: by which i mean, i was asking questions and he was not answering
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: don't try to tell me you're surprised 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose not
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's such a tragedy having to put those blue dragons down
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they're elegant and powerful, if not fully realized.... so much time wasted on pointless projects
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think you've forgotten the part where you don't have to put them down at all
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: half of them are undead and half of them are just evil of their own accord
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can summon chimichanga too
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i keep getting the feeling that people like my voidwalker more than they like me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh my god
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it might help if you were more likeable 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just, like, fundamentally 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: pair of pots calling the kettle black...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not the one complaining about it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wasn't complainin
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: g
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, no, you wretched horrible creature, your horrible dog is dead
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this wretched man
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ohhh, putriticide....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i cannot. wait. to see you dead.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am going to burn this man's lab.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that seems a little harsh for someone on your side
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we are only conceptually on the same side
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: in the same way that, say, we're on sylvanas' side
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ghh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i despise him and everything he stands for
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ahhhh, that's satisfying.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it must sting, for him to have his very own lab in icecrown citadel, and  you to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, im still here, and he isn't, so,
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're very, very lucky to still be here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i could have been here, i'm sure, but i have my own workshop. i preferred to be off on my own.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: alright uh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we're gonna see how this goes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: besides, i rarely had to interact with these people
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah, in theory 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i came to ice crown citadel if i had business with arthas. i don't deal with others.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nordaras will try to not die.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm gonna get her attention, hopefully get cursed, wait for like, a minute, and then come back here and eat nordaras 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im gonna stand behind this thing
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: once i eat nordaras, bring him back and i'll eat him again, and then i can eat either of you for the third one
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: in theory 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if i do this will you stop being such a dick
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: MINOR PROBLEM
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: OH DEAR
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okay so... bad
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that also hurts way more than i thought it would
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that debuff is rough
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it does when you have No Armor 
Kelahnias has died.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think this would go better with someone who is... higher level
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe i can just pull her and not... actually hurt her 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and keep all of my clothes. on.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and we will come forward a bit i guess
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the issue is one of those debuffs
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it just deals so much damage it keeps killing me before i can read what it is
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i need her to bite me and then wait a minute for the buff to kick in so i can bite her 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: err bite someone else 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and basically i just.. need to do that three times, so it's a waiting game
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i can also switch to blood spec to be.. a bit more sturdy
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: let's just.. give it another shot and read what's actually happening 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we can also just. let nordaras stay dead until i can actually bite him
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: works for me
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's. an option. but it doesn't get me what i need, slackjaw
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nobody else can summon chimichanga, and you can't get into my house and the cats will die.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do you want the cats to die
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: fuck you, blood queen, your dress at the holiday party was tacky and inappropriate
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and your brownies suck
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: 15 more seconds until i can bite somebody
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im still dead but i can be bit
Kelahnias has died.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: AH
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh my god what
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i was,,, maybe too slow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so maybe get up on me and res me earlier?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how's kel's cooldown?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i can rez you right before the debuff goes off, i think 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm good 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: cool
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: or i can bite slackjaw and we can see what happens 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's the spirit, i think 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but if i need to bite three people i don't know if i can just bite the same person three times or what 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that would be... helpful, but i'm not sure 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, let's find out
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: alright i'll bite slack first to see what happens
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and, uh, before That happens
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you guys are so much fun
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think i can handle it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: 20 seconds
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im chillin
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: WHERE SHE GOING
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: DOESN'T WORK
Kelahnias has died.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how did that go, guys
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so i definitely need to bite nordaras, let him die, bring him back, bite him again, and then i can bite slackjaw
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we're learning, that's what counts
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i dont like this plan one bit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i guess
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i just imagine sword ghost watching all this like "these idiots actually fucking killed me??"
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so i'll use my rez right before it goes off the first time, and i'll give slackjaw a 10 second warning to rez you for the second one 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: GOD yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do u wanna get on voice?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and then i'll just. bite slimjim
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it might... help coordinate this close timing
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: god yeah i'm just.. technically watching tv with my mom
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: "i love u but i need to get this axe in world of warcraft and it's hard"
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: adsjkfhkj i mean
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: IM SURE SHE'D UNDERSTAND
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: this episode'll be over soon, i think
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aight i can chill
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i need more pain meds anyway im dyin
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: get yaselves some meds n some dranks 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh my god it is way cooler outside than in but my fan isn't like, strong enough to get it going
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh noo
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im lettin the window hang open and i'll take a shower before bed
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: actually lemme go grab soemthing while ur finishin tv
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm glad we could all take this time to hang out with one another i really think it's going well 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hopefully lorsaen will understand if i bring back a really cool horse 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, it is for work! mograine himself asked me to do this 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, not in those exact words, but it's a lot closer to that than most people would guess 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: why are you all lot this
Nordaras.
Kelahnias chuckles at Slåckjaw.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am both fighting the legion and letting you clowns literally bite me and kill me
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're doing amazingly 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: at what point do you stop being dicks
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you remind me of my mother, in an odd way
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nothing is good enough for you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we all eat people sometimes, you aren't special
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: excuse me, i think i've been surprisingly decent these past few days 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: also, there's not much on these bones
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, kelahnias, you've been lovely.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: also wanna give this one more shot bc turns out i actually have no idea when this episode will end 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we went on that adventure in the titan halls!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i believe in the power of love 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you seemed like you were having fun, at least 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it was a grand time
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: can we go kill other people?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: does uh... does anyone have bandages
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hhh no because the frost quest is after this one so i need sindragosa 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh gotcha
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i mean i was asking for the boss fight but thanks
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can't use these
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: unfortuante
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: u have to be 101
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i have 8000 piece of frostweave 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: who is most likely to die who shouldnt
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: of you two
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the other 7,921 are in my bank, i assure you 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: who wants a soulstone
Kelahnias creates: Healthstone.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: kel's been slightly less of a dick to me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so he gets the magic self-res stone
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i do my best 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you've caught me in a very rare good mood, as it turns out 
Kelahnias gently pats Slåckjaw.
Kelahnias.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aw man that targeting
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the green dragon will
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: alright i'll use my rez first, then slack'll use his 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and if kel goes down he can get back up
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'll give you a bit of time before the debuff pops so you'll have some Time 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and we can bandage each other if we need to 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: alright, one down
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: great
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh hm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: is it saying... why?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: WHAT
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh wild i didn't know the spell worked that way 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i guess you can only use it once
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i guess
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i only have a debuff for 4 minutes tho
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: y'know i might have a solution for this 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and it's called ask my brother to log on 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was about to guess that
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: goodbye, cruel world
Kelahnias has died.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do we wanna do that now? he'll have to get through a Lot of icc to get to us
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well we can clear everything Up to sindragosa
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean it'll put him in our instance he just has to walk
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh u rite
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but, uh, now you understand why i've been stuck on this questchain for Forever 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what a mess
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i just want the crimson deathcharger :(
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but yeah if we could.. get Up to sindragosa and not kill her that'd be neat cause supposedly that quest is way easier
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oops
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: all my shit is broken
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, you can repair downstairs at least 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: keelah do you have all the icc achievements?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: better question
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do u have the Icebound Frostbrood Vanquisher
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do you.. want it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we can Get It 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: SLACKJAW
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the elevator boss....
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I SAW
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: YOU BROKE YOUR EVERYTHING
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so what was that about not trying to die?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: welp
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: pity
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it happens a lot
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're not the most sturdy of individuals
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: nordaras,
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: now you understand why i have a voidwalker
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you alright down there 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i died again
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah i noticed 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it happens
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i need to sell too jesus
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: god this episode won't end!!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what is it... of??
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: dexter's talkin to a gay ukrainian in a gay bar and they're just. havin a chat 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh my god
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yea
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it disturbs me that i can skin the spider people
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: here's the true reason i'm so close with arthas: i just die so fucking much that he keeps having to come fetch me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: stranger things have happened
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're not special
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've died more times in the past hour than you have... ever
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: alright it's... finally ending....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's hard to tell
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im gonna grab something real quick
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ye go for it i still have to rope my brother in and he might be in a league match or something stupid 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: disown him
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's the thought that counts
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm gonna go to the bathroom and then i can hop in voice 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bye
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: come hang with me on the dead person stairs
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: will do
Kelahnias threatens The Lich King with the wrath of doom.
Kelahnias gently pats Indy.
Kelahnias loves Tiptoe.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn gently kisses Arthas' forehead. Stop slapping him!
Kelahnias loves Tiptoe.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn holds Arthas' hand.
Kelahnias slaps The Lich King across the face. Ouch!
Kelahnias smacks you upside the head.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: fUck u
Nordaras-ArgentDawn waves at Bolvar.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's so unfashionable...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: god i love him so much
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you are... the worst
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you're very original
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but am i Wrong 
Kelahnias thinks The Lich King is the son of a motherless ogre.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't deny the truth of things, kelahnias, i'm aware that i'm not a nice or good man
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's fine this is a typical friday night for us
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i didn't need to know that 
Kelahnias points at The Lich King.
Kelahnias laughs at The Lich King.
Kelahnias pokes The Lich King.  Hey!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i dont think thats me
Kelahnias tells Slåckjaw NO.  Not going to happen.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: don't blame the minion for the master's deeds!!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: listen i understand why you had to kill arthas but you come for chimichanga and i fucking end you, slackjaw
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, like you?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: then step off and stop chompin at me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: technically that's where demons fucking with paladins gets us
Kelahnias bonks Slåckjaw on the noggin.  Doh!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: either horribly corrupted people, or uh... fel goop
Kelahnias bonks you on the noggin.  Doh!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not to name any names
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's just uncalled for 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, i'm not wrong
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... i can never move from this spot 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's how he eats people
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's going to slowly dissolve you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's how he gets you
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean i feel mostly fine 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yeah, but
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... alright, slackjaw,
Kelahnias loves Arlagos.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was wondering what those chew marks were
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: look at my fat little son
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: fffuck you
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: look at my perfect ghost daughter 
Kelahnias cries.
Kelahnias gently pats Slåckjaw.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: intriguing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: come here a moment, would you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it feels like we're standing on the edge of the world, doesn't it?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: like this could be outland. or if this continent had just... wandered off, the rest of azeroth none the wiser
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's no trick of your eyes, arithnan. i don't think there's anything down there. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what does it make you feel, looking out at this kind of nothingness? it's a genuine question. i have my answers but i... wonder what it is you feel, staring into nothingness.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i haven't had the chance to visit outland, unfortunately. i would love to, but when most people were heading there i was otherwise occupied.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that's. not what i was expecting. i rarely get an honest answer when i ask people questions. i would rather have honestly over 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: "deepness" any day.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i understand your feelings, though. it's almost comforting, the idea of just... nothing. but at the same time, it's terrifying.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that does sound fascinating
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: did you ever figure it out?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, not every experiment can be exciting. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: speaking of excitement: we have a sha to kill, don't we?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the only difference between entertaining yourself and experimenting is if you write it down
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, no time like the present
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the sha are just so fascinating
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't know what they really are or how they work
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: IS THAT LIAM
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: WHY DOES THE SHA OF VIOLENCE SOUND LIKE ILLIDAN
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: why can i roll need on that axe
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can't even USE it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: like i can't equip axes at all
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how intriguing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Cowl of Angry ThoughtsAntagonist's Headwrap which color
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh i get both appearances
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's very stuffy in here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i need to go sell some things
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sometimes when you have wet hair you do things you arent proud of
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this grummle has a cat statue and i want it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's a production, believe me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i normally just tie it back in a low ponytail if i need it out of my face
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's just... such a hassle
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it's been a very long time since i last cut it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: quite a few years
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i trim any dead bits at the end, of course, i'm not an animal, but... certainly not since i first went to northrend, and it was fairly long even when i first arrived
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i left more regularly than most
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the work i do requires a variety of alchemical reagents, few of which could be acquired in northrend, or by thralls
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i needed to see them myself, for quality, and any latent qualities that a lesser person might miss
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i bring my home with me, as well. a clever enchantment that has served me well over the years. i set myself up high in the mountains, overlooking icecrown and crystalsong, right up against the titan ruins of the storm peaks...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it was a beautiful view.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and it gave me the resources, time, and dedication to finally set myself to work seriously on a project i had long considered, but never gotten around to
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you have a way with words like none other, arithnan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: some take easier to certain aspects of it than others, i think
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the enchantment wasn't my own working, of course, i purchased the workshop in silvermoon when it was still a gem of arcane power
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's... a bit of a legend among archaeologists and alchemists alike. it's called the vial of the sands
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: an ancient recipe that, as legend claimed, would allow the consumer to temporarily take the form of a stone drake
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: of course, the recipe itself was lost to time, and the ingredients are bizarre and esoteric, and very few believed it existed at all
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it is, admittedly... mostly sand. special sand, of course, but i can't imagine it was pleasant to consume
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it.. wasn't exactly just for professional curiosity. i had the support i needed to finally get to work on it, but the intentions were... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, we thought we were on the right side.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the potion itself, of course, was never compromised.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: too finnicky for that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wasn't going to risk the integrity of my work by introducing an element like the plague
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you're... right about that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i certainly do know. but all things considered, i have surprisingly few regrets. i finished a project i had long dreamed of but never really thought i could finish. i proved *everyone* who doubted me wrong.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it would definitely suck.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think you're wiser than you give yourself credit for, arithnan. very few people are as understanding as you, i've found.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that feeling, i definitely understand
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it was meant for lorsaen starwing all along. i opted to give it to him, to decide what to do with it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: in theory, i could make another, although gathering the reagents might take time...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: although you do already have wings of your own.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, well, there is that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if you carry me more than ten feet off the ground, i'm going to turn you into a sheep
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would prefer not to break too many bones
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how many times have you tried before?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i will also have you know that i have a metal hand, i'm very slightly heavier than i look
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, probably not
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, yes, he and i have crossed paths before
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wait, is that where i know you from?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i thought you looked vaguely familiar
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thalanor and i tolerate each other primarily because neither of us wishes to incur alecea's wrath
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: she and i have been friends a very long time
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we drink tea and gossip
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do we need to get this man here?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you would think with my fire magic i could do this
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i got enough of enormous bugs in northrend
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I GOT IN A CANON
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: CANNON
Nordaras, Liberator of Orgrimmar'.
Nordaras, over here at the exit.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: IS THE INFERNAL STILL NAMED CHARNAGMA FOR YOU
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okay this guys just got messed up briefly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i like the big boy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wish chimichanga was big :(
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i love him but he is Small
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm tall for a blood elf, sure, but not That tall
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so dungeon quests seem to still reward decent xp and i dont wanna go to draenor
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do we wanna do other pandaria dungeons?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do we suppose heroics reward more xp?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: flight point
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i still.... cannot fly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so there's also mogu'shan palace in here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yeah that would be great
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: someday i would love to do some of wrathion's horseshit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but that probably requires doing the Actual pandaria campaign doesn't it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh that sucks
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh well fuck that i dont have that money on nordaras
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think i spent all my shit on random armor lmao
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nordaras can just ride arithnan instead and put up with all the innuendo that entails
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so the quests arent As good on xp but the enemies and the dungeon itself are still good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have a... dog?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn nervously pats Jade Quilen.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it says im at 1 of 5
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's 2...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would prefer if it was
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i tend to dislike dogs
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've always preferred cats
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but ive had run-ins with wolves
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no accounting for taste, i suppoe
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: suppose
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: TWO OF THEM
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: more lions... moRE LIONS
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: were gonna have to check every room
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this is what archaeology is all about
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: BIG ONE
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we've all been there
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: get that boy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that was only partially about the lion
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mostly about the boss
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it was a problem mostly due to who my boss was
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it makes me... rather unpopular
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: rather unsanitary
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: probably at the very beginning
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: before i realized they were there
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there were some side rooms we never checked
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't know what we get but i want it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: GOT HIM
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's just an achievement
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i want to KEEP THEM
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: theyre good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so that did not... do a ton of xp so i guess nordaras gets to go to... fuckin... draenor...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooh yea we can do that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: NUTS NO
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i dont want this
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was cleanin my quests
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what's the best way to get there?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess fuckin... undercity, yeah?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wait which ones are we doing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i immediately forgot
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's all plaguey
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i really do despise this place
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's a perfectly functional castle right here, and sylvanas lives in the sewers
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess it's for the best that she hasn't claimed the throne for herself. i wonder if-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nevermind.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it just... reminded me of arthas. to say i didn't mind him would be an understatement. i just... miss him, sometimes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm certain i'm the only person in all the realms who feels that way, but, it is what it is.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i knew him differently than most did.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, no. no, i was not kidding.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wow, these sentries are soooo perceptive.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have the taint of the scourge? what gave it away?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the echo in my voice? my glowing, unearthly eyes? the conversation about arthas?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i know it was for the best that the scourge was stopped but sometimes i still get offended that idiots like this actually played a part in it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh no
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: dogs
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hungry dogs, too, oh good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: just kill them, please
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what is wrong with this man
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh i don't... like this..
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im going to not look at the dead bodies of people mauled by dogs, if it's all the same to everyone else
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't even eat any more but i think i'll be sick
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no no no don't burn the books!
Nordaras.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you heard the woman
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, just... getting over to the other part of these idiots' hideout
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this would be a lovely little monastery if it wasn't filled with horrible people and also on fire
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: me neither
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i can appreciate culture and beautiful architecture
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you arent an entirely lost cause
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'll make a cultured traveler of you yet, arithnan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, we all do what we must
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: holy light
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: is not good for my health
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: why are these guys russian/german
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh boy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: woah she ran right through that table
Nordaras!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i stabbed her leg and ass
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: uh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hi, lillian
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: color me unsurprised
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im fuckin... wiped out so im probably gonna hearth and go to bed
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: its been a Long Day
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: god the squirrel
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do that a lot
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: also stop being mean to him :(
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am.... in the middle of an ogre-controlled fortress at the moment
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it isn't a fun time, no!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: when i expressed my dislike of wolves to you, that did not mean i liked being gored by wild pigs much better!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it is very, very, not good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: charnagma is mostly keeping me safe, thankfully
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i did forcibly bind him to my will
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but he seems fond of traveling and of soft fuzzy things, so i don't think he completely hates me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, being bound by me?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you did walk into that one
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank you, i was proud of it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Stuffed Ogron Doll this is an... interesting thing i've just found
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think most people would find that rather threatening, arithnan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, not particularly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose not
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i did just threaten to tie you up, so, i suppose that makes us even
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh? what would you rather be, then?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i *am* known for my creativity
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he was throwing rocks at me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think what he was expressing was "trying to kill me"
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's an orge, what do you expect?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think you overestimate them
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: shall we go kill some more of them? i have no idea where this mine is, but it sounds like plenty of people to fight
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: come outside
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how far do we need to be to not be instanced i wonder
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, where do we suppose this dungeon is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: did you just... drink that?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that had to be disgusting
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: normally people say that about whiskey, or champagne
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not... paint thinner
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh no
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this isn't it at all
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: just please don't get it near me while im casting
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i discovered personally the poor effects of alcohol on fire-based spells
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: especially when the caster has been imbibing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh... oh dear
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's certainly less than ideal
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no i would prefer not to
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: barbeque tonight, everyone!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...i mean, i don't eat, but i'm sure it would be delicious
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: can we pleaaase kill him
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it'll be funny
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oooh, rough day for you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hmph. they're certainly welcome to try to take me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have served only one master in my life and he's long gone
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: unfortunate for these draenei
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they seem a species destined to sufferrr
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you would think the light might be kinder to its most devout worshippers
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...what am i saying, of course it isn't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: me neither
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but it seems like so often, those who serve the light the most faithfully find themselves suffering the most at the hands of darkness
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: a rather cruel joke, don't you think?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, it doesn't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'd drink to that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do too, unfortunately
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do these people know they can leave? they're free
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have some from pandaria i've been saving
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's shtronger than i expected it to be
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: those pandaren really know their drinks
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm sure they would be.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we do seem to find ourselves in snowy areas quite a bit, don't we, arithnan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mostly due to familiarity, i suppose
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do find it quite beautiful, i will admit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've always traveled to try to leave things behind me, and it's always been that the further i go from home, the more i'm reminded of what i left behind
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it always comes back for you, doesn't it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, i guess you can't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: arithnan, may i ask you a rather... personal question?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i shouldn't take advantage of your drunkenness like this, should i...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: when i say the word "home", what first comes to mind?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's no right or wrong answers
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm just... curious
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i understand where you're coming from. i wondered if you might feel the same way. i return to northrend from time to time but it's... never the same.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: without the people you wanted to return to, it's not really a home worth returning to, is it?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's certainly why i left in the first place...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wish i had answers for you, arithnan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if your people don't mind the snow, i happen to know a great fortress in icecrown that was, until recently, completely unpenetrated
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: very secure, very remote
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it might get a little melted with how warm you all are, but that's how things are sometimes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i'm sure it's not going anywhere any time soon
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think avoiding unpleasant thoughts is fairly normal
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm fine
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it happens surprisingly often
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: with the legion on our doorstep, i think planning even a day ahead is too far
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it seems to have worked out for you so far
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you're still standing and so few are
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that is... a big kitty
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, these orcs are dating, huh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: er, correction, were
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm gonna garrison
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright im gonna go to bed so i can sell people their damnged books tomorrow.... gnight!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think so too
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: lemme turn in
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aw shit that sounds good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aw hell yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's a troublemaker!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: flying pets always annoy me and get in my way but i love my fat son
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's certainly intimidating
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, is she?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm, this is already bad
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, but what a gorgeous place this is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, isn't this exciting!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: let's endeavor to keep it from being lost the same way ours is, hm?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we may be the first outsiders here, but it would be a shame for this to be lost to everyone
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's a sick weapon
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Soulcutter Mageblade
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh this is a liam raenei
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: draenei
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and not any more he isn't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: a very good thing, yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: some people just give warlocks a bad name
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: at least i'm fighting on mostly the right side
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that's a given
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, look at this guy and his voidwalker
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you show him who's boss, charnagma
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ma'am i could build a house inside that thing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: woah i hit superior before legion
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they were worse a moment ago
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think it's a draenei thing, with their hooves and all
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i try not to be too offensive to the people i visit, it's much easier to get guides and access to things if you're friendly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if that means having exposed toes, well, so be it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: gross
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, in another level and a half, i can actually do another dungeon
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yaaay
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okey dokey!
Nordaras.
Nordaras.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i keep uninstalling the handynotes treasures thing but it's... really convenient for getting some easy extra xp in draenor
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: speaking of which,
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hell yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: cool im still.. not sure where it is lmao
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: reshad is my favorite boy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you know
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i discovered this morning that the best time to do dungeons is first thing in the morning
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bc like, the assholes are still asleep
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: generally people who are up early on the weekends are... not dicks
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im so sad about this staf
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: f
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's admiral taylors
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and it just always fucks me up that the reward u get from him is a pandaria model with a note attached
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: like he was meaning to send it to you all along
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's okay he has an entire town of fellow ghosts
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: uh oh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it uh..... went poorly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: those winds around the corner fucked me up
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: u sure did
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah you killed the boss
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: its good now
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sure did
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh this staff is like, a claw thing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it animates
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it happens
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright i guess uh... i'll hit garrison to get out
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aw yeah that would be cool
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sorry i had to run to the bathroom but that's def the sort of thing erileas would do
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: OH NO ARITHNAN
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: esp since i had imagined, like, erileas gets thrown across the floor and loses his grip on the glaives midair and picks up illidan's bc he just... landed near 'em
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: which i guess means i need to figure out what the deal w the warglaives of azzinoth is, if he's gonna have those ghhh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but it probably lends a lot of credence to erileas being in charge because the warglaives, like, accepted him
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hell yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they REALLY DO they glow and have stars for a Special boy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think it might be, yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: since we have so many dungeons that people need to run
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Anzu's Piercing Talon god look at this sword....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i like nordaras w staves, esp since that's... what he's gonna end up having, but the idea of him being a sword/off hand dude is... rad
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's so cool
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and also, like, being able to stab in close quarters would be really helpful in his field
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: god i lov her
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oops
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i fought a ton of slimes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im pretty sure im One Bonus Zone From Legion
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: your belief might be misplaced
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: OH MY GOD I'M SO FAR FROM THE POINT
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: uh if he felt like hoppin on that would be lovely
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: although if i would stop fighting a huge group at once it would be better
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can meet you at fizzwhistle to give you a ride if u want
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im gonna go grab some pretzels while im chillin
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im back apparently today is "roommate's parents visit" day
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nah don't worry
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okay i need... one specific thing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or like, two named npcs
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if you see someone named brokenfang, lemme know
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright uh the adventure guide isn't giving it to me but i can just hit orgrimmar and get the quest, right?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: cool i'm OUTTA here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or actually im gonna turn in a quest real quick but
Nordaras, over here! If you hear any news, please let me know at once. It takes time to pack up my goods.
Nordaras? It calls to you!
Nordaras!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i might leave group bc im sure im gonna be in phased stuff in a hot second
Kelahnias greets you with a hearty hello!
Kelahnias with a hearty hello!
Kelahnias with respect.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: god that's spooky 
Kelahnias salutes you with respect.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh here i can. fly you
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: asdhfk yeah
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: THAT TOO
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: of course not, i just thought it'd be nice to offer
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: any idea which one of these comes first?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: is that in character
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: asdfjk
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: kel, sitting here trying to think of something to say so it's not awkward
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: GOD 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so.. how are... things? training's progressing well? no one's giving you any trouble? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's good! and you know if anyone does try to treat you poorly for some reason, you can always talk to me. i won't stand for having any of the members of the ebon blade being somehow looked down upon 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i understand completely. anything on your mind i can somehow help with? not that there needs to be, of course, just, if you've got something
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: is that... mercer
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's.. quite lovely
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and you... want to know why?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think... that's a question we've all asked, at some point or another. the real problem is i'm not sure there's an answer you'll be happy with 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't think that means you have any more or any less purpose than the rest of us, arlagos 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just because you were the only one from your brood doesn't mean you were the only one freed from the scourge after light's hope
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just... luckier. or unluckier, depending on how you look at it. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think the 'why' matters less than what you do with it, but you certainly don't have to adopt my viewpoint 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know what that feels like, you're right 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: there are plenty of other people who have gone bad that weren't dragons, arlagos 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you can't take responsibility for an entire group, you know 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if you want to still be that, and you think you still can, i see no reason not to pursue it
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... understand what you mean by that, at least 
Kelahnias laughs.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i can't even imagine 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, no, i was agreeing with you! i just can't speak to having any knowledge of leylines
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i've felt that way about a few other things, though
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i would imagine so 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i was never very good at magic 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's.... different
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean i was as tuned to the sunwell as any other elf, i guess, but magic was never my strong suit 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i never cast a fireball, or conjured a pie, or whatever it is mages do 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh shoot yeah 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... preferred to make it the old fashioned way, but it's certainly neat 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, yes, but it's not... 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's not the *same* 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: have you ever compared how a frostmage casts with how we.. do what we do? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe it's different for you, being a dragon and all, but it doesn't seem to come from the same place, if that makes sense 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i've never looked at a frostmage and thought their magic felt... sinister. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: would you say the same about blood death knights? unholy? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's only awful because they think it is? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no one i have ever met knew how to use this kind of magic before arthas and the scourge infused them with it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not taking magic out of the air, or some font of energy, i'm pulling it out of *me*, because i'm just... like this! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry i don't... i didn't mean to sound rude, i just... 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's.. tough. and i'm sure you've got a point. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not all of us can stay so connected to what we used to be, i guess. i'm honestly a little jealous 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe this your chance to prove that sentiment wrong, then? because i see one very competent blue whelp standing in front of me
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry you're... how old? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i take it not that old, then 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you sound like wrathion trying to defend the fact he was only two when i first met him 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ooh, harsh! you must be in the moody teenager phase
Kelahnias chuckles at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm sure you're quite intimidating, don't worry 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and you were just schooling me on the properties of magic, so don't be too offended 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'll certainly do my best 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: though, really, i don't see why you couldn't do both 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'd say that'd be fantastic, but argus is right on our doorstep so i'm not sure how much good it would do
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i've met a few magisters who might could give you a run for your money, but i'd rather skip out on the contest 
Kelahnias waves goodbye to you.  Farewell!
Kelahnias salutes you with respect.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i will be there just as soon as i can get out of this wretched city
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or more specifically, the wretched sewers
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: god the upper part of lordaeron is so pretty and really looks like it does in w3 but nooooo we gotta live in the sewers
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or like, it looks the way the architecture does
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, that sylvanas is tasteless and dramatic?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: please put that down
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have enough to deal with with your brother-in-law eating every damn thing he picks up
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: just being safe, my friend
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, i have. we get along rather well, actually
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i certainly agree with that. he's a bit wild but he and i... have more in common than i had expected us to
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose i can't debate that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, no, i understand completely
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: arithnan is kind to me. i cannot say that about most people.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think we aggravate people the same way, but somehow don't bother each other
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i think that's part of it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we have a surprising number of life experiences in common
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or, unlife, as the case may be
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh no
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: remind me to put your soul in a marble when you get over here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: WHAT
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and to answer your question, i would consider demon hunters cursed, certainly, as well as corrupted
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but they've never died, so they're certainly not undead
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he claims to have only done it because he thought it would be fun, but so many of the illidari have fallen in battle, or to the legion's corruption
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think it is, in part
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i doubt he would still be standing if that was all of his motivations
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't believe in luck, alecea
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's only people who are smart enough not to let anyone know that they're smart
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't exactly want to hang out with them, they just refuse to let me do anything without ""supervision""
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: as if i'm a petulant child who is so corrupt that i might defect to the legion on a moment's notice
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: as if simply because i played the system and understood more than them, i was somehow more in control of myself in the scourge!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: after what they've pulled, i guess i'm not surpised. you know what they say about pointing fingers and the other three pointing back at you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, were you not in that meeting?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh dear.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the deathlords got the brilliant idea to try to raise tirion fordring as one of their four horsemen
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the former highlord, of course, being held in light's hope chapel
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there was a... minor tussle
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it ended in highlord ginaara screaming herself nearly hoarse at all of them. i think she might have *spat* on kelahnias.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i gave her a bottle of wine after the dust had settled and i think she drank most of it in one go
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, we certainly cannot
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, well, one can hope
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think deathlord kelahnias is slightly less likely to stab me now than he used to
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's only a, say, 70% probability, instead of a 95% chance
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's... more to it than that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and it's both vaguely comforting and deeply concerning
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bolvar is, to everyone's surprise but mine, starting to cause trouble
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's been.... contacting people
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's left me alone, thankfully. i suppose he figured that i was too much part of arthas' order for him to get to
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't know how much of the ebon blade's actions have been influenced by him
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but it's certainly concerning
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, and speaking of concerning things, i told you about my staff, yes?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it, ah, it turns out that what fuels these lovely orbs in it is souls!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: a "hundred demon souls sacrificed by a hundred warlocks" or some such nonsense
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm as unhappy with it as you are, believe me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i believe i could purify the demons from the weapon, but it's highly likely it would leave it utterly inert
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so... for now, i have no other options
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's still very good for hitting people over the head with
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: until i can figure out a better solution, i suppose i'll just have to endeavor not to rip apart the fabric of reality too badly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i could give it to my assistant here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm sure he'd make good use of a weapon
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think he would get indigestion
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hmm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if it is, what does that mean about the illidari?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, but they are partially
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hmm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: anyway, i just... thought you should know about the staff, in case i start cackling evilly or something
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, probably on argus, all things considered
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if you find yourself in the company of any powerful ghosts with a desire to fight the legion, do let me know
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, you mean like this?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: because that's just how i laugh normally
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this is profiling!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, yes, you do
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: uther is a bitch
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: don't give it to the ebon blade
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: who knows what they might do with it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you know
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nice hat, alecea
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, slackjaw seems to enjoy exercising his new ability to speak at any moment
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: taalle doesn't care about anything, so she's a safe bet
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and kelahnias seems to be....reasonable, at least
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose i can't think of any reason he would be unkind to you, in particular
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: don't tell him i said that, i'll never hear the end of it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you could always ask arlagos, he does love company
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: although i'm not certain how much he knows
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we don't get to talk as much as i'd like. he's so busy these days, with... everything
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there certainly is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he does have such intriguing views on so many things
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, you and i have never had as much time to talk as we'd like
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: his thoughts on magic and the uses of it are just fascinating
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: even as a young whelp, completely without the social structure of the blue dragonflight, it was like he came to it utterly innately
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if you can get him to stop talking philosophy long enough to actually ask your questions, he might have some insight on the ebon blade's actions
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: clearly, things haven't gone too far bad, as he hasn't come running home in tears yet
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nor has he written me any particularly emotionally letters as of late. i got a number of them when he first joined, when he was having a hard time settling in, but they've gradually tapered off as he finds his place
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so i think he's doing alright, at least, and doesn't *feel* like he's being too badly excluded, or like things have gone too horribly wrong
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he certainly is. i'm... proud of him, i guess. he's a being of immense power and i had the blessing of getting to teach him in his earliest years
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: me, teaching a blue dragon! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we can only hope
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, thank you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i certainly hope so as well
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's the best definition for it, yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's still who he is, and i can enjoy the aspects of casual flirting, but he... he understands that i'm...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he gets it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i broke a lot of my own rules for arthas. when i was still caught up in it... i thought it would be forever, you know? not... us, exactly, but... the whole situation
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: moving on is... harder than i expected. harder that it normally would be for me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not from my end, at least. i... keep wondering about arthas. if he was just indulging me because it kept me in line. it's... been on my mind for a while-- years, now, i suppose-- but kelahnias brought it up to me a little while back, and that's....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess i'll never have answers for that one.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'd... like to believe that it wasn't all a lie. that whatever part of him was still *him* felt the same
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but... like you said, it's not a question i'm gonna get answered
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, one way or another, it's not worth dwelling on.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i believe
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm just waiting for them to point me towards something to hit and then i'll hit it i can't comprehend all this nonsense 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh i... already left
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ooh he looks good 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: krokul hovel
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... yes?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sometimes i like to live dangerously 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the roads are your friend, dear
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: illidan, i'm not sure you have to convince us, but alright 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: they're so small.... the illidari couldn't afford to give him bigger glaives??
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he's wielding butter knives
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it just seems like something they should have! he's the boss!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't see why they couldn't just... make bigger ones. special order them
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's... certainly something
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do you think illidan spent all those years in the twisting nether just... coming up with odd one-liners about how much he dislikes the legion
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i suppose you're right 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the dead demons, i would imagine
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the legion tends to do that a lot
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: kind of like the scourge, which makes sense, i guess
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: she sounded pretty sincere but i have No idea what she means
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i didn't realize the legion had like... an ideology. i thought it was just world domination and all that 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but she sure sounded convinced 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: there's... only a slight inconvenience in the fact we're using mechs that channel the power of the light
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm just... a little crispy, is all
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, if you want to sit there and rub lotion on me i certainly wouldn't complain, 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but it didn't kill us!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we're completely fine, mostly 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i was a bit distracted, sorry, but i think it's a wonderful idea 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i would really rather if you didn't do that 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i feel like i'd be obligated to jump after you, and you know how i get about heights
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's... beautiful here
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's a look
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he's rocking that eyepatch
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sorry i got distracted by the mini named "gloamwing"
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: :/
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i didn't realize the draenei played with the arcane so much
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: OH NO
elahnias pets Pygmy Marsuul.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: they've even got mana wurms!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: who would've thought, we travel to an entirely different planet, destroyed thousands of years ago, and it feels... so similar to home
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it sure does 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if you need to go to bed you can :0
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: normally i wouldn't say i'm a particularly cunning individual but i want to beat this trial just to prove this dumb robot wrong 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wild these guys cound as enemies
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, elivan, i've heard some interesting rumours floating around
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wouldn't you? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you ought to, the latest gossip seems to concern you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, elivan.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you and that deathlord, actually
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it depends on if there's any truth to the notion of... the two of you?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what does "sort of" mean in this context?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh! well, that's... something
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm glad for you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: elivan, dear, i dated the lich king
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am in no position to be judgemental
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not that it's ever stopped me before, i suppose, but in this case, i'll make an exception
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's a bit hostile towards me, yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i'm not going to begrudge him his happiness. sometimes, i'm capable of being the bigger person.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hmph. i'm perfectly willing to be friends with the ebon blade, but they seem incabable of understanding the big picture
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: although i suppose he did seem to like the cats, so maybe that's a start
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how does the picture get bigger than the burning legion? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i sincerely doubt many in their ranks are concerned with the old gods and the void and the titans and the light.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or would they have rather been in service to the dreadlords?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, but they seem determined to ignore that the scourge was originally a tool of the legion
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it seems like that might add incentive to their campaign, to know that it was demons who initially inflicted the plague upon azeroth
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, it's not that, it's-!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nevermind. i feel like a broken record these days, trying to explain the facts to people who have no interest in hearing them.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they despise me because i understand that their despised arthas was, in many ways, as much a victim as the rest of them. that he was, by my count, three degrees removed from the source of the scourge.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they refuse to acknowledge that perhaps, their quest for revenge would be better targeted against the legion.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and it is EXHAUSTING, elivan, to try to work with these people, to try to listen to them, and to be told that what i know to be true is wrong
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: simply because it does not fit their narrative
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's... a very lonely way to be, i suppose.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i shouldn't put all this on you, my apologies. i'm happy for you, elivan, i honestly am.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't want you to think i'm bitter, or trying to sabotage you somehow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do, in fact, acknowledge that arthas did awful things. i don't think anyone in their right mind would. but so did every single knight of the ebon blade. and they can comprehend that they were manipulated and corrupted by forces beyond their control.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but they seem utterly incapable of considering that it might have been further spread than that. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hmph. i'm used to being told i'm wrong. i'm simply not a fan of being told i'm wrong and immoral by people who are, empirically, no better than i am.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've long since given up on winning the approval of those who are determined to dislike me, elivan, but i appreviate the sentiment
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've found that it only ends in more pain.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose for the right person, it could be worthwhile. but i've accepted, over the years, that i may just be fundamentally unlikable by most.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've accepted it, elivan, you don't need to fuss. i have my cats, i have this big purple lump. it's fine.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am. fine.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: don't make that face, you'll get wrinkles.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can see your brows, elivan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not when the legion is on our doorstep. there's bigger issues right now. my emotional state of being is the least of our worries at the moment.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that's nice, but, once again, not the time or place. can we continue, please?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: tell me how you and slackjaw got involved. i do love a good romance story.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's often small moments that stick with you most, even years down the road
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i respect if you don't wish to speak about it. i understand a need for privacy.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i didn't say i wanted thrilling, but it's okay if you don't want to tell me about it. i like to hear my friends talk about things that make them happy, but if you have no desire to tell me, i don't mind.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn smiles.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, the classics.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: things only get to be classics if they deserve it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wouldn't have pegged him as a flowers man, but what do i know? sometimes the unexpected makes things better.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how very darling. even if he didn't know, it sounds like that gesture meant a lot to you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: then that's better than any sordid tale of a passionate affair. believe me, i have more than a few of those tales myself, and none of them have the worth of something so simple and meaningful.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm happy for you, elivan.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you deserve good things in your life.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's-- not what i said.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the only time i've had something good, it was at the expense of my free will and the cause of a countless deaths and pain across azeroth.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's not that i don't want to be-- happy, and in love, and whatever, but it doesn't seem to be in the stars for my life.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or un-life, as it were.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wasn't a particularly good person, nor did have a great many friends, even before i died.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's a fairly unique perspective, elivan. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: look, my friend, i appreciate it. but i've learned since a fairly young age that i'm not going to fit in, i'm not going to be good enough for anyone.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: all i can do is continue doing what i do best and remind myself that nobody else's opinion matters. once we beat the legion back, i can go back to doing my own thing, and it won't matter any more.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if i don't, elivan, where the fuck do i go? i have nothing. *nothing*. the only people who give a shit about me are you, whose job it is, archmage alecea, who i've known since forever, and the dragon i raised as practically my son. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the only time i've ever felt loved and supported, like i was actually understood, like someone cared when i left, was when i was part of the scourge. where the fuck do i go from here? i've got a goddamn pet voidlord and more cats than
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i know what to do wish. i've got a ton of family that's probably all dead by now and hates me anyway. i make potions that nobody will drink because they all hate me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've been rejected enough times that i'm unwilling to try again. if someone rejects me because of the way i act, that's fine. that's not me. but i'm not going to bare my soul to people on the off chance that they might be kind to me, because i've 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: been hurt badly and often enough that i'm not willing to risk it again.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm just acting off of what i've been told, elivan.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: maybe i'm not as strong as you are, elivan. i can't take that kind of vitriol. i just can't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can't be good at being a good guy. but i can be very good at being the ominous warlock everyone loves to hate, who sometimes shows up to help solve a specific problem and then vanishes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- i didn't know that, elivan. i'm truly sorry.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- i wish i could believe you, elivan. i don't want to be alone. i don't *want* to be this isolated. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i'm not willing to risk getting hurt, over and over again, by seeking the approval of people who have already made up their minds about me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think my fears are perfectly valid. your boyfriend would gladly throw me to the wolves without a moment's hesitation, i'm certain. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i don't use that figure of speech lightly.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's *allowed* to have you, to move on from all the horrible things he did, the things every member of the ebon blade did, but i'm not allowed to express that i miss the one person who ever fucking had it in them to love me?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- i'm sorry, that's. that's uncalled for.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that's news to me, on both counts.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they all seem pretty convinced to me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's fine. but you can't shake a stick without being reminded that arthas was a monster. their perspective is well established, and the notion that maybe there's facts out there that contradict it...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that maybe, i would fucking know more about what he was actually doing than they did
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, that's going too far. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they still have a future. they have an organization, lovers, something to recover from, to move on from.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: all i have is the knowledge that the only goddamn good thing i ever had was based on being a monster.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: at least they have each other. people who have been through the same things they have. most of them had factions, goals, people they worked with, before they died. i never had that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i don't have it now.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not the point. they know how to exist as a team. they *have* a team. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it has only ever been me, alone.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: a small handful of friends-- nearly tripled now, actually, so good on me for that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think they at least fucking have the option! people with similar experiences and skills to them
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can't work with the ebon blade, obviously. i can't work with the sin'dorei, i never felt like quel'thalas was home and they wouldn't have me, anyway. i can't work with the warlocks because the netherlord hates undead.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you have the priests, elivan. i don't even have that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no matter what i do, how hard i try, i cannot make myself good enough to be tolerable, much less likable.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright, four friends. but that still doesn't take away all the shit i get. i'm just-- i'm tired of trying to fight what people think of me. i was tired of it before i died. why bother trying to contradict them?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: all four of you, you know what you have in common? you didn't hate me right off the bat. i don't think i've ever changed someone's opinion of me once they've formed it. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: to me? no. against the people who despise me? yes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not an optimist, elivan. i try not to put effort into lost causes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i keep putting myself around them because i want to stop the legion, and to do that, maybe i'll have to put up with them.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't want to have to interact with them any more than they want to interact with me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i had hoped that they might at least respect my dedication to my work, but even that's met with suspicion. like they can't conceive of someone like me trying to fight the legion.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: as if i don't live on azeroth, too.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i shouldn't need to defend myself at every turn just to be able to fight the legion. i want to do my work, stop these monsters, and then never speak to any of these people ever again. then they can hate me from a distance, and we'll all be perfectly happy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or, as happy as i ever am
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i like being free. i like being alone. it's only when i'm forced to be around other people that i feel lonely.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i traveled azeroth with no-one but charnagma for company for over a hundred years.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it wasn't until i died and was forced to be part of something stable that i started being like this.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's certainly inconvenient.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: listen, you-- you've given me a lot to think about, elivan, and i appreciate you listening to me complain. but i-- i want to just get back into fighting, please, if we could.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think i can recognize disdain and anger pretty well. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's worth considering, i suppose, but i don't particularly care about the emotions of people who would happily leave me to die without thinking twice. save them a lot of trouble, i'm certain.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have no evidence that any of them will appreciate being psychoanalyzed. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i have a lot of evidence to suggest that they deeply dislike me and everything i do, even when it could very directly benefit them.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'll keep it in mind, but don't expect a miracle. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sure it doesn't.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it seems like hatred is the only thing they have to keep themselves held together.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: fine. you have my word. but if this ends with me getting cleaved in two, i'm going to be very cross.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's one of my skills.
Nordaras!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: (IT WOULD BE SO BAD GHHHH THE LAST TIME THE FILE SAVED WAS LIKE LITERALLY AN HOUR AGO SO I'M HOPING IT JUST,,,, NEEDS A SECOND
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bc that's the Entire second half of that conversation
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: gnight!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: valanar has... too many signet rings for one man
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, that's a matter of opinion
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: elves aren't the only ones with ten fingers,
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: was that the staff you wanted?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: heck yeah
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but humans, dwarves, i think orcs... all ten fingers
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: draenei!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: arla, i have silkweave bandgaes
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: GOD
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: bandagagesg
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're not!!! we can only use them once a minute!!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i guess try all taking her portals and see if it resets?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: err, i'll try, anyways 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just because it'll... take a while to die
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think.. i'll just wait 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's me, incredibly boring
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i try to avoid death when i can
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: your mother tried to KILL you
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's fine
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hey, arthas
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: fuck you 
Kelahnias threatens The Lich King with the wrath of doom.
Kelahnias apologizes to you.  Sorry!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that sounds like it'd be nice
Kelahnias makes a rude gesture at The Lich King.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: people are mean, too
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: at least dolphins aren't reanimating people for fun yet
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: have you ever seen an undead dolphin???
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: arla, 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: there are so many other things to live in fear of 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: than undead, necromancer dolphins 
Kelahnias waves at Highlord Darion Mograine.
Kelahnias salutes Highlord Darion Mograine with respect.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no shoes, we die like men
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: uh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not generally
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think the bigger question here is why is garrosh so short 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's true 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: tragic
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: illidan doesn't have eyebrows either :/
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i guess but it's still bad 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: can you imagine
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no eyebrows
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm so sorry
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: don't say that 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know, i think blood elves are fairly close to cats anyways 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: have you ever met lorsaen? it's like if you took a cat and a bird and combined them into a person--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that cat absolutely has eyebrows!!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: those could fit right on a night elf!!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do.. real bears have sideburns?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it sounds very complicated 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: should i tell nordaras you've made a new friend next time i see him?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: MY BEAR FELL ASLEEP, TOO
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you certainly are effective at that, deathlord
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: at... what? killing? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, stopping groups of people all at once
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm certainly effective at killing people, too
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, i've had a lot more practice than i would've liked
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but just one at once
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i suppose both are useful in different situations 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: don't presume that i-- ah, i mean, i've spent more time having to kill than i'd care for, either, but i suppose under different circumstances
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: people get so touchy about their archaeology
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: because you never-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well. different circumstances and all that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this has always been my favorite part of quel'thalas
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the... ocean? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not.... this island, but anywhere you can see the sea
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: why?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the idea of what lay beyond.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i always wanted to leave.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... liked the trees. not anything unique, i guess, but... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ....how many generations removed from the highborne are you?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ....i kid, i kid
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the trees are lovely, but i've never been one for nature, i suppose. not much you can learn from a tree without cutting it down.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i just... sitting up on a branch, surrounded by all those leaves, the colors.. it was like getting away from everything else, i guess, but i never wanted to leave. none of the trees anywhere else felt the same. just quel'thalas. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think a lot of our people feel the same way
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: probably. i told you, not very unique. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was... certainly a bit of an outsider, for wanting so badly to leave. had it not been for alecea and thalanor, i might have never returned
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: unique... is not always a good thing, deathlord. i know that quite well.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, being incredibly typical hasn't seemed to do me much good, either
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't think i would describe anything that you have done in your life as typical, at least as far as i'm aware
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i appreciate the comment-- i think-- but you don't... know me very well 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's... it's slightly unrelated, but i did have something i wanted to tell you, nordaras, if you'd be willing to hear me out 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: of course, deathlord, i-- try to consider myself at least a decent listener
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn instinctively takes a deep breath. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... i wanted to apologize. to you. for.. for how i've treated you in the past. we have our differences, and i'm not sure we can resolve them, but i... i'd like to think i can admit when i'm wrong, and i will admit that i--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that i misjudged you. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn Heartbinder blinks. Huh?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you have... done your best to assist us in the fight against the legion, even when no one was willing to give you much credit and.. and that counts for something. or it should, at least. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i just.. i don't want to waste my energy trying to hate someone that doesn't deserve it. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so i'm... sorry. for being cruel, and doubting your intentions. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, deathlord, you-- i-- you've managed to leave me more or less speechless
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm... not sure how i should feel about that 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am... unaccustomed to people giving me second chances
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's a rare thing, you should consider yourself accomplished
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well i... i was given a second chance, after light's hope, and-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know if i deserved it or not but it's.. second chances are important. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i.. appreciate it, deathlord. really, more than you know. and i... may have lashed out unfairly. i try to be willing to change, but, ah, you know how it is after 200 years to get set in your ways
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.... don't, but i think i understand the sentiment 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry, what?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: deathlord, how, ah, how old *are* you?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i, ah... 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do you still count the years after you died? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: an interesting question, but i feel like you're dodging the question
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but let me pose a new one: what year were you born?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if you... count the first war as year 0, then... -9. 29 when i died. i don't know if i'm still techncially aging anymore. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh. oh, by the void, that's... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry, i didn't realize you were so young to have... this much thrown on your shoulders
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's unfair to have so much forced on you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's not... it's not a big deal. i know i complain a lot but.. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's just how things turned out. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: very little in this world is fair. you know that. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: of course, i'm aware of that. still, *i* have been unfair to you. i... assumed we were closer in age than we are. not that i don't know you're an adult, but... i hate to pile on to that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, deathlord, not to overstep my bounds, but-- you are both important and relatively young. the legion has... a history of picking targets like you. if you feel like you're slipping towards that... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do let me know. i can handle demonic situations with subtlety that, say, a paladin cannot
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're not piling onto anything, heartbinder. it's not as if i was treating you any kinder. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and it's not... i'm... i'm fine. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but i... the offer is appreciated
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, the offer stands, deathlord. we can ill afford to be separated and falling to corruption at a time like this.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you of all people should know what hell even one corrupted man can unleash.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i-- i know. believe me. it just... hasn't been the legion. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you say that like something else has been on your mind. arlagos has been... odd of late, as well. what happened?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: other than an incredibly reckless attempt at fighting every paladin in azeroth, i mean.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sorry, that was... uncalled for
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, you're... right. completely right. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that wasn't... it wasn't our idea. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: deathlord. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what is going on.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's... we've been working with the new lich king. bolvar fordragon. and i know-- i know how hypocritical that is but it's... we were just trying to avoid fighting the legion and the scourge all at the same time and-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry, what?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: WHAT?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how-- how is that even possible? you were broken from the lich king, he shouldn't be able to get back into your heads without some serious effort!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i KNOW that
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know... i don't know what to do. i don't know what choice i have. s-sometimes it's so loud i don't know... if i've got a choice. but what am i going to do, nordaras? we can't fight a two front war. we won't win. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not.. exactly a master tactician, kelahnias, and i never have been. i can't... answer that. but at least... at least the highlord is a good woman. if things go horribly sideways, we can at least... hopefully fix things again.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we're probably safe until the legion is defeated, at least. the scourge was once a tool of the legion, and whatever part of the lich king is... inherently the lich king, independent of the man on the chair...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think he doesn't want to go back to the legion, and the legion would love to have that particular tool back in their posession.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and at least some of us can be prepared for when it starts up again.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's... what i'm hoping. and it's not.. it's not like it doesn't help in the fight, what he's asking us to do, but it's not... it's not right. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, it rarely is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's plenty of things that would help in this fight that wouldn't be right
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, i think the ebon blade's responsible for quite a few of them right now. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if what you say is true, and i have no doubt that it is, you can't beat yourself up over it too badly.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's not exactly what you would choose to do, is it? being used by the legion, the scourge, whatever, and being... innately evil, those are very different things.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, it's not what i would choose to do. but that doesn't mean it's not still me. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's the nature of the legion, and by extension the scouge, and why they're so hard to stop. the conversion and corruption of the defenders of a world is far more effective than simply invading
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...ah. that is... telling, kelahnias.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose we could debate semantics all day, but, from my perspective, it's clear where the blame lies. and it isn't on the ebon blade, in this situation.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't... i don't agree. there is.. no scenario where i don't have to answer for what i've done, but-- i appreciate it, all the same. it is... so exhausting, trying to fight so many battles all at once. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you aren't alone, at least somewhat. if things go very, very poorly, i will not let the forces of azeroth condemn the ebon blade to death for forces beyond your control.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you have my word, frostlord, for however much that is worth.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... thank you. i didn't expect kindness from you. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm full of surprises.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: apparently. though i have... something else that may push the limits of that. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: is it a pony?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: because i can think of very few things that would top... all of that
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no i... one of the things bolvar did was arrange for each of the deathlords to obtain a powerful weapon to use against the legion. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, i think we've all done that, which is how i wound up with a staff that rips holes in reality.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes but this is-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well. slackjaw acquired the maw of the damned, some sort of legion axe that makes snacks out of people, or something. taalle took the blade apocalypse, another legion blade. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mhmm.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aubrey louvell has a floating skull that talks sometimes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: where are we going with this?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.... got the shards of frostmourne. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you... you... what?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i need to sit down..
Nordaras-ArgentDawn Heartbinder rubs his temples.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's... that's not all. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you have frostmourne.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how many twists can you throw at me in two minutes?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i-- i can stop, if you want. i don't feel any better about it than you do. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, please tell me, or i'll go completely insane
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and you're only the second person outside of the ebon blade to know, anyways
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it, ah... it turns out frostmourne still... contains some of the remnants of it's last wielder. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ....frostlord,
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: frostlord, what are you saying.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: a... ghost. or an echo. maybe a memory, i don't know. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: frostlord, if you're trying to mess with me, it's not funny.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not messing with you. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- this is... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's still-- he's still here?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... at least a part of him. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's-- that, i-- i could-- it'd be a risk but--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn Heartbinder rubs at his eyes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sorry, that was incoherent. let me try again.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the scepter of sargeras is, as you can probably tell by the name and the eerie green glow, a weapon of the legion. it runs on fel energy.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... i'm listening. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: more specifically, the souls of thousands of demons. a hundred warlocks each sacrifcied a hundred demons for this thing.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: obviously, this makes me incredibly uncomfortable. but-- and i'd need to check my notes on this-- i believe the conversion rate between the power of a willing soul and an unwilling one is nearly exponential.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- i could, in theory, purge most of the legion's influence from this staff, and... replace it with arthas.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're think you could... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it would still be inextricably linked to the void, but i'm far more comfortable with that than having condensed fel energy strapped to me
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if you.... wanted to try this, i wouldn't be opposed to it. as long as that's all you plan to do. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not an overly ambitious man, kelahnias. this is a long enough shot already, i wouldn't risk it by trying anything weird.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i just... you understand. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm an alchemist with a knack for fire magic and summoning void creatures, not a necromancer. i don't think i could if i tried.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm,  i doubt that. i'm just... i trust you, with this. and because i think you know he wouldn't want that, anyways. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and what would i do with him if i did? it's not as if he could go anywhere without being attacked. no, i-- i'll start my calculations when we get done here, and i'll let you know when i know if this has a good chance to work.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and... thank you. this-- it means more than you know. it really does.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, i-- it will be better for all parties involved, i think. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and i just... i thought you should know.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: though i... would appreciate it if you didn't spread that knowledge around. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: of course not, kelahnias. there's not that many people i speak to, anyway. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... thanks. can i ask something of you, though? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think i owe you at least that much.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: please, please stop calling me that. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...your name or your title?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh i don't.. i don't care about the title. just please, if you're going to say it, don't say 'kelahnias.' kel is more than fine. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i... hadn't realized it bothered you. i try to avoid presuming with nicknames.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: a personal bias, you must understand. there are very few things you can do with 'nordaras' that don't sound at least vaguely insulting.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's fine! i just. sort of hate it. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen has a similar problem
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what a humorous coincidence
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: is it? it makes pet names ridiculously hard. i already feel like 'dear' is off the table for me since he uses it so much..
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, i'm useless with those
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, this is that gentleman arla is always complaining about
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he's legitimately the worst. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: did you... really not like quel'thalas?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i didn't hate it, but i didn't like it any more than any other place i visited
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i only came back for the people, but i only ever left again because of the people, as well
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... i see 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea and i have been friends since... well, forever
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it must be nice to have a friendship that can survive.. well, everything that's happened
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i...am not proud to admit it now, but i still cared for her as a friend while still fully part of the scourge. i.... petitioned arthas to ensure that she and thalanor would be allowed to keep their minds. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i insisted that they would be more effective if kept together.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i... would appreciate if you didn't relay that information to her, but... i still cared for her, in that warped way.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wanted her to be on what i believed was the "right" side of that war. i thought.... well, it doesn't matter now.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, i... i get it. you thought you were being kind. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: as soon as i came to my senses, i sent umbra to dalaran with a letter in its bags, hoping the kirin tor would still be able to reach her.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: for what it's worth, i also insisted that you and lorsaen not be separated. it... would clearly have been less than ideal for either of you, but it was clear that you were better as a team. or at least, clear enough to get away with.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, it's the thought that counts, i guess. not that the lich king would've given me any semblance of myself if i'd been dragged back into the scourge again. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, i suppose not.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but, arthas did give me his word to keep the various couples and closest teams together. i can't say why.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess you could ask, yourself.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i still have nightmares about that, you know. or whatever you want to call them. of dying again and waking up not myself. losing control again. anxiety, i guess you could call it. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: because that's the worst part of it, you know? you remember. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, i know.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... don't think i want the answer, either way. but i understand what you tried to do. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: still i... i think it was admirable, that you were still willing to contact her afterwards. i could never bring myself to do something like that. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i didn't know where to go from there. the knights of the ebon blade... you were all together, and could move forward as a team.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but arla had gone to find you all, and once i-- once i dealt with arthas' body, i didn't know where to go from there. i wrote her in desperation. but she's... she's a good woman. she has always been very forgiving.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: she wouldn't have put up with me for more than 200 years, otherwise.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: a good friend. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: though i... think you believe the ebon blade was a bit more united than it actually was. which i understand and it's... it's still better than having nothing, i think, but... none of us knew what to do, after icecrown. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: a lot of people just. wandered off. or joined something else, like the horde, or the alliance, hoping for some other kind of purpose. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't think most of us even imagined we'd make it that far. that northrend was... it. the end. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but it was still better than just being alone, i think. i'm not trying to say it was worse just that... it wasn't easy, y'know. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i understand. but you were... military before you died, correct?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah i was-- i was a farstrider. just barely, but it counts. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: right. i... i don't want to get into the depressing tale of my youth, but, well, i never spent much time in quel'thalas for a reason. i didn't have anything to be part of here, not with family, not with any... organization.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've never had a cause. never had something to be... part of, to be passionate about.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm... i'm sorry. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the only time i was part of anything was the scourge. and that's awful, isn't it? but i was finally... part of a cause.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i suppose legionfall counts, somewhat, but it just doesn't feel... cohesive.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: like as soon as the legion is handled, we'll all go back to hating each other again.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're... not wrong 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and i... i know this won't appeal to you, especially with how some of the other knights treat you, and the general feelings about arthas, but.. you are allowed to join the ebon blade, if you.. if you're looking for. something. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know, it's a stupid idea, and i understand why i just... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i, ah, appreciate the sentiment, but i think i would like to avoid being cleaved into pieces
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah. probably. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mostly, i'm happy with how things are. but... i didn't enjoy the scourge because i like to boil children while cackling like a wicked witch. i enjoyed it because i'm a very poorly adjusted person who is very skilled at avoiding his feelings.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but you...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: did you ever...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: did you... ever kill any children? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't... i'm sorry that's...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's... you don't have to answer that. please don't. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: did i do it? no. did charnagma, and later, arla, do it on my orders?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so you-- you understand, at least a bit. i can't forget that. i can't forgive it. not arthas, not myself. not the legion, as you so often point out. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was never a front lines fighter, if that's what you're asking. i was never commanded to kill those people, or have them killed. it just...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i-- i didn't get that choice. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's not a pleasant one.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wasn't supposed to get into any fights that time, either. just gather a few reagents and get home. having the choice doesn't make things better, believe me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'll confess, i've utterly lost the thread of this conversation.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah it's... none of it matters now, does it 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's the spirit
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's just... it's been years since that happened, and.. for a while i thought i was getting better, that i could put it behind me, but now with everything that's happening i'm... i don't know. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i can't go back to that. not ever. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, hopefully we can find a more permanent solution to the situation than just swapping out new paladins every few years
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: eventually we're bound to run out of them
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hmph. maybe if we stopped trusting paladins to do everything right, we'd be better off right now
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, now you just sound like me
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well. it just seems like a lot of problems can be traced back to paladins, is all. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's not entirely fair
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sometimes it's orcs!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, you're right
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: anyways. i mostly just wanted to apologize to you. it got... a little out of hand, but that was the goal. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if we're... being honest, i practiced that for over a week and still managed to fuck up the delivery
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i appreciate your honesty, kel.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, i've been told i'm a terrible liar, so might as well come out and say it 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and thank you, for... everything you've told me. you've given me a lot to think about and work on, so i might... vanish for a bit to figure out all the pieces. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... understand 
Kelahnias nods at you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well. that's more than enough emotions from me for today, i think
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's... time for a nap, or something. or i guess just... bed. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: go be with your lover. maybe you'll have a stroke of inspiration for a pet name
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hah, maybe. it's got to hit me eventually, right? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have an extensive collection of terrible romance novels somewhere, if you're searching for inspiration
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they've been gifts from alecea over the years
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we like to get each other gifts that are heartfelt and well thought out to be just awful enough to be delightful
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that is... incredible. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i used to have an easier time of it. people sell all kinds of absolute garbage in various markets around azeroth, and it's intriguingly exotic enough to be fun
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not sure if romance books are the way to go, but maybe i should buy something ridiculous like that sometime. just to show lorsaen i'm actively working on the whole sense of humor, thing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i have an extensive collection of ridiculous things at my disposal.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe a pair of awful socks, or something 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and if, ah, your... temperature situation becomes... inconvenient, do let me know. i'm certain i have ways of remedying that sort of thing in one way or another.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: awful socks are classics for a reason.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... well, you should ask lorsaen about that. i'm sure he'd be able to complain in full detail 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the only problem is i'm afraid he'd actually wear them. the man has no fear. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: apparently.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, he did decide to date me of all people, so it's... not a hard assertion to make. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i'm walking proof that sometimes, people have odd tastes.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: there's someone for everyone, as they say 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i suppose you're right
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: anyway, i should really get to work on this whole process. lots of research in my future. it's...nice to have something to be working towards again.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, of course. just.. keep me up to date. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: of course. you'll know as soon as i figure anything out.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aw shoot
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i plan to aggro all of these guys and then start attacking
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bc i have few aoes and even fewer instacasts
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: charnagma is inconvenient for this kind of dungeon
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'M SORRY
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'll put him on passive
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what did yoU DO
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: remind me to soulstone you when you get back
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was about to ask what you needed me to do, but you seem to have answered that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, i've been... very well. busy, you know?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i... don't wish to show all my cards now, but i might have a solution to the whole... demon staff situation
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: deathlord kelahnias, who apparently hates being called by his full first name, and i had a lovely chat the other day
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and for once i don't mean that sarcastically. i think someone gave him a talking-to.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: in theory, yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not sure he wanted me spreading it around too far, you know how it is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: why did you not tell me that, alecea? gracious.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: anyway, it would seem that those lovely swords of his are made from the shards of *frostmourne*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that was my reaction as well
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and, according to him, it seems like... not every soul was released when the blade shattered
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: arthas' soul is still trapped within the blade, or blades, as it were
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i know! i know. but he seemed earnest and willing to be rid of him
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and the calculations are rough, and so much is based on conjecture, but one willing soul, as strong as arthas' must be to have survived this long...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: theoretically, i could simply swap him in.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i thought so as well-- you'll have to check my numbers, of course, but it... seems about right
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it seems obvious when you know that a willing, powerful soul is available
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but that's such a rare occurance that it would seem like an utterly ridiculous train of thought before
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, old habits die hard
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not than any of his habits are *particularly* old, given how young he is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you know, being young and making poor choices in the face of the legion invading your home
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and, to be fair, i'm currently wielding a staff that was used by ner'zuhl to destroy draenor
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think a lot of people are making questionable choices
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm quite capable of being civil, as long as people aren't hostile to me first
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i... also had a bit of a chat, in which elivan scolded me for being too quick to judge
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think he was having an off day, too, he got... as heated as i've ever seen him
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: truly, the end of the world.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- yes, he did. i suppose a shadow priest is supposed to be able to target the psyche, but it was still startling how easily he cut to my core. i'm-- still a bit shaken
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mmm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm certain you have nothing to worry about, alecea
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, if you didn't know either of them, would you think kel or arithnan was older?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i did think he was rather immature for his age, but i-- didn't realize
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i judged him assuming we were peers, not that he was-- he was so young
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: heck
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it certainly is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i... i'm not sure what to say.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i... think a great many people felt the same way. that it was unfair.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not *that* long ago
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's certainly accurate
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it feels like a long time ago, i agree
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i understand, alecea. not... your exact situation, but i do understand the concept.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it seems to be a common thread of the past 30-odd years
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, hopefully things go well against the legion
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and maybe everything will... calm down, at least for a bit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hmm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the plants might take revenge for being eaten so much
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: meat only from now on
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea, i traveled the world before any of this got quite this bad, and azeroth was never fully safe
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you just have to hope
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not to sound like too much of an optimist
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea. breathe.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, none of us can back out at this point. believe me, i'm not a huge fan of this "hero of azeroth" deal.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but it also means that this isn't all on you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you're allowed to be upset, alecea, there's a lot going on right now.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you don't need to be the eternal optimist around me. you've never managed to convince me to be as enthusiastic as you before, i'm a lost cause. it's okay.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think we can spare at least 5 minutes for being upset.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: maybe 4 and a half?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that seems reasonable, but i think it's important to keep yourself from losing it completely
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: remember the breathing thing, alecea.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, demons are dangerous, but so are a great many things.  i will remind you that out of the all the things in northrend that could have killed me, all the demons and undead set loose, it was wolves that ended up taking me down.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not sure if it's helpful to keep that in mind, but people were fighting and dying for azeroth even before we got involved.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, because you could have gotten killed by wolves at literally any point
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: things have always been horribly dangerous
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea, i'm not.... i'm not good at being comforting, but i'm... i do care about you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i... will do anything i can, within reason, to make sure that you and your husband are okay
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: don't worry about it, alecea. you've put up with all kinds of nonsense from me over the years.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: RUN
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: u can't hit those guys at all
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alright im.... probably gonna go to bed bc i keep staying up too late and bein Unhappy in the morning
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, elivan, how have you been? it's been a while
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can think of very few ways it could be worse, but i take your point
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: optimism has never been one of my strong points, i'm afraid
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm? oh, dear, dear, elivan, your definition of harsh and mine are very different. it was, in all honesty, exactly what i needed to hear. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you'll be happy to know that i managed to send your beloved a letter without it ending in bloodshed, and you'll be happy to hear that the frostlord and i have reached an accord of sorts.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mm, indeed. i don't wish to spill all of the frostlord's secrets-- you understand, of course-- but i believe we've come to an agreement that will be mutually beneficial.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: optimism isn't my strongsuit, but investing in my continued survival certainly is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you've never been there on the few times that slackjaw and i have interacted, elivan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, best of luck to you, on that one
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: apparently we look like dogs to this woman
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: maybe her wolf mask is enchanted and makes her see poorly?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not any more, she doesn't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you know, arlagos has a lot of things to say about the dear archmage kalecgos
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: very few of them are flattering
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i had my own reasons for attempting to earn the respect of the frostlord. not to sound like too much of a cliche, cackling villain, but other than my own survival, there's nothing that i want from slackjaw
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: come here you edgy idiot
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: does the dragon soul look like a large gold piece to you?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: (get an amalgamation through the red glowies on the ground
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aw heck
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, although....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that doesn't look good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i fucked up
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: autorun.... uh.... turned itself on
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Have I misunderstood, or did Alexstraza just tell Thrall to have sex with his wife so they can start having more children?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, i suppose that might be the case as well
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: although apparently fairly recently, if aggra wasn't aware of the situation
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose they were destressing, during the cataclysm?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, no, certainly not
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, so i could be at face height with the aspect of life's breasts, instead of her nether regions?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that would be her waist, elivan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: she's a dragon, i'm not sure she cares. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: besides, i think i'm quite tall enough as it is. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you probably have an easier time buying shirts than i do
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm, yes, i do tend to prefer to get my clothing custom-tailored
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: very few robes have enough pockets and range of movement for the travels i usually find myself on
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: especially not for the amount of things i have to pick up
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he does seem to have quite the knack for it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i assume very shortly, we will either have considerably more free time, or no free time ever again
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so one way or another, it won't be a problem
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: true, but, not to tempt fate, but it does seem like fighting a corrupted titan might be as big as it gets
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or do you know things that i do not?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, don't mistake me for an optimist
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's just as likely-- maybe more so-- that we fail horribly and die at sargeras' hands, left to rot on argus, our souls just so much more fuel for the legion
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but in that case, we really won't need to worry about half-abandoned hobbies any more
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, either way, it works out
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what? i'm not wrong, am i?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, i'm not exactly worried, anymore. i've died once already. i'm going to keep fighting, no matter what. it doesn't keep me up at night. but i'm aware of the odds, here, and just how closely we skirt the edge of failure at all times
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was making a poor attempt at humor in response to your lack of time for hobbies, but, alas, my sense of humor has never been a strong suit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or, at least, my ability to come across as joking
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it wasn't a particularly funny joke, either. er,
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm. anyway. our potential firey doom aside, ah, how about the weather?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that is fascnating, isn't it? the planet seems to be utterly without weather, which i had assumed was a given.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and the way it's shattered! i do hope we can continue to clear the legion from its surface, if only to study their cities in peace
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's a sentence i would use for, say, suramar, or the inn at goldshire-- don't go there, by the way, i think you would be appalled--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not an entire other planet
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: goldshire is-- how do i describe it? to quote a man i met once, you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villany. it's where the, ah, deviants of azeroth flock to-- couple, for lack of a more appropriate term
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: named for its proximity to the gold mines, of course
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's a bit of a nothing town, to be frank. more of a mining outpost just outside stormwind.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but of course! i've been all over azeroth, well before most of these wars even began!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or, in some cases, resurfaced...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's a lovely town. i can't speak to its current state, of course; it's been rebuilt once or twice since i was last there.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've only been inside once, but it's certainly striking. i've always felt that the best places of worship are those that could almost inspire the less-than-pious to attend a service or several
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and by that metric, the stormwind cathedral is nearly number one.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have little personal appreciation for religion, but great appreciation for the architecture, art, and culture that it produces
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm. i don't know that i have much i could say, my friend. i have never had faith in much of anything, i'm afraid i can't especially relate.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that does sound quite lovely, i will admit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: people do love their little clubs
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: besides, it seems to be just asking for people to try and break in, just to see it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not, ah, that i would ever do a thing like that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, that doesn't surprise me in the slightest. i'll have to keep an eye out for him, then.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i'm certainly not complaining, personally. i'm sure he has his reasons for being like that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm, i suppose that's a valid concern. i haven't had the chance to speak with him about it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i don't think anyone was expecting *that* to happen. even i was surprised by just how horribly that naaru was behaving. denying people the freedom to choose how to live their lives, that's what the legion does, what the scourge did. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was under the impression that the naaru and the light were supposed to be the *good* guys.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm. perhaps you'll come out the big hero after all.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose it does seem like the light has a habit of abandoning its servants when they need it most.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we're fighting a literal titan on a strange planet that illidan stormrage, known colloquially as "the betrayer", summoned to sit within throwing distance
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think everything has already gone wrong
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: besides, with recent developments, it may very well be that drawing power from the old gods is actually a safer bet
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: color me intrigued about this talking dagger of yours
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh. in what way is she awful?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we could certainly try it!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that sounds unnervingly like my experience with the scourge.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm... sorry you have to put up with that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it shouldn't have to be. we can cross that bridge when we get to it, but it's good to be aware of it, just in case you start chanting backwards or anything like that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you're certainly not the only one in this sort of situation with your weapons, if it makes you feel better.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wasn't sure it would make you feel better, no. but, at least you know?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, i'm not an especially comforting person
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, there might be some changes in that club's membership shortly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: don't worry too much about it, it'll be for the best
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i promise that if it works out, i will come and tell you. but i don't want to go spreading anyone else's secrets around.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and more than that, i don't want to jinx myself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i always know what i'm getting into! mostly.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm doing my research, and plenty of planning. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have my reasons, believe me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they'll be making a killing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, well, i should really return to my research. i'm nearly finished with my calculations, and i want to get into your club as soon as possible.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... your cat's name is... sharon?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: one of the cats, yes
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ..... why 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: she's normally very shy, i'm surprised at her
Kelahnias pets Sharon.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: because my dear mother had a long-standing feud with a woman down the street named sharon, and i thought it would be funny.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that doesn't.... are you messing with me 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, absolutely not!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think you're messing with me... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: go look in the census records. sha'ron whitecastle.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... what...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you put a lot of faith in my ability to invent bizarre situations. believe me, you aren't the first person to be flabbergasted by my family.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's incredible. what a ridiculous name for an elf. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you would not believe some of the utterly preposterous things that the minor nobles of quel'thalas name their children. i was downright lucky to be named nordaras.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have an elder sister named, and i am not lying to you, this woman is named "bethany". except, my delightful parents spelled it "b-e-t-h-o-n-i-e". bethonie. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that poor woman... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they had a phase where they delighted in giving their children human names, but spelled in uniquely elven, or pehaps just tasteless, ways
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i didn't exactly spend a lot of time around the nobles of quel'thalas, which i'm sure shocks you, but now i'm almost sad i missed it just to hear silly names 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's actually awful 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i kept a list of the best ones in one of my journals-- from right before i left the first time, i believe. if you'd like, i can send you a copy. there are some incredibly poorly named people out there.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that sounds like a fantastic pastime 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: forget pillow talk, let's read about the unfortunately named nobles of quel'thalas
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: believe me, save the names, you didn't miss much by not being associated with them. they were, well, the kind of horrible people who produce me as a child. except, of course, they couldn't see that they were awful, which makes it worse.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... always thought they seemed too stuffy for their own good. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they're all horrible. most of my family is alive. there's a reason i've reached out to archmage alecea and her dear husband, and not to my family.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not that i fear their reaction, oh no. but i'm finally rid of any chance that they might force me to speak to them.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's... a surprisingly positive way to look at things, especially coming from you 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: they must have been legitimately atrocious 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: funny how those are the sorts of people are the ones that made it through the scourge invasion alive, i guess 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wasn't the black sheep of the family by any means, kel. the only way in which i broke tradition was by not being good enough a fire mage, and by running away. i had to learn my morals from somewhere, after all.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: my unsolicited advice is, if you find yourself in the company of anyone of the heartwood family, to politely excuse yourself, and then run like hell the moment you're out of their line of sight.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they aren't worth speaking to, even just to laugh at how terrible they are.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm.. sure they wouldn't want to speak to me, anyways, but i'll remember the advice 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mm. yes, do that. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do you have-- that's probably a bad question. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was going to ask if you had any family, still, but, ah, most people are not as callous as i am on that topic.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, i... 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: my.. my mother's still alive. i only found out recently. a baker in dalaran all this time, who would've thought? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, that's-- is that a good or bad thing?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... she's a good woman. a kind soul. but i.. i don't know if she needed to know i was still around, is all 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, an esteemed hero of azeroth, and one of the key players in the fight against the legion? you sell yourself short, frostlord. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i won't say i can't imagine a mother who wouldn't be proud of you, because i very easily can, but if she wasn't, she'd be an idiot.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's.. it's not that, she was.. so nice to me, when i saw her. proud. like nothing had changed. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it doesn't sound like there's a problem, to me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: unless i've missed something?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, i... i had two other siblings, is the thing. and i-- those sorts of attachments are targets for the scourge, you know, a way to prove loyalty and i..
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, no. kel, i'm--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no it's.. it's fine, i just.. she could've had her two other children, and instead she's got me, and she doesn't even know because there's no way i could-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... you understand 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i understand.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you were in a situation where all of your limited choices were bad ones, and took the path of least resistance. not only that, but you weren't yourself at the time. not fully.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but if you have family members who still love you, who still want to spend time with you-- first of all, it's not your decision to make, if your mother still wants to interact with you, if she still loves you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: second, you-- you have that, still. if she still loves you, that's not worth throwing away. you have something that not all of us do.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: don't waste it because you're still carrying your guilt.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you sound like a fancier version of lorsaen 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am going to choose to take that a compliment.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you most likely know what i think about your level of free will, and where the blame for your actions lays. i will refrain from harping upon it further.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's... it's alright. i appreciate it.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i didn't mean to make everything so dramatic i just-- i wanted to answer your question, is all 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, i do appreciate it. but, you do know, i only ask things because of genuine curiosity. i will never be upset if you refuse. if things are too personal.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm no mind reader, hence, the need to ask questions.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it.. it doesn't bother me, to be asked or to answer, usually. diificult, maybe, but i don't mind. most people just.. don't ask
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you ought to know by now that i am definitively not most people.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, certainly not 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, shall we continue to channel our various unresolved issues into the slaying of our foes?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: therapy and a meal, all for free 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, i do have an update on our little project! it
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i was... just about to ask if you'd made any progress 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it will be a little finnicky, by which i mean, it will end very poorly if things go wrong, but i don't believe they will go wrong
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: what's the worst that could happen? everything explodes and we both die? tragic, 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i just need to be somewhere that i can release the souls of these demons without actually freeing them
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's... a bit out of my area of expertise, i'm afraid. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do believe that the soul conduits in the reliquary of icecrown citadel might do the trick. the demons won't be particularly useful outside of the staff, but i believe they will at least be trapped.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe a question for a demon hunter 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, that's... interesting 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: a soul is a soul is a soul, at the end of the day.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: right. of course you'd thought of something, or you wouldn't mention it to begin with
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: better demon souls be trapped there than anyone else, i guess 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: besides, as i so often remind everyone, everything the scourge has done is based on the legion's magic. i don't see any reason that the souls couldn't be caught there. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: fair enough
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it might work better in icecrown, anyway. the connection between frostmourne, arthas, and this world is strongest there, anyway.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean that... seems reasonable 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, let's finish the task at hand, first, and then see if we can't creep around under bolvar's nose a little bit.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: our... ability to creep around is practically nonexistent, but i appreciate the sentiment 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh whoops
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, maybe not creeping around, but i don't particularly want to, say, go up and say "hello, this is what we're doing"
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: certainly not, but hopefully my presence will be enough to let us slip by, at least 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... you have no idea how much i detest what i just said 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can certainly be somewhat more sneaky than you are. at least i make less noise.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, well, at least it will serve us well in this situation.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: noise has nothing to do with it, nordaras. bolvar's range of sight isn't nearly as far as arthas' was, but he's stepped up his sight into his own citadel for any number of reasons 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's deeply concerning
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: more than a little 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i had hoped to not face any resistance into the reliquary, considering how thoroughly you all cleared things out.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but it seems like that may not be the case.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you.. might be disappointed 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i know thalanor had a particularly rought time trying to recover felo'melorn
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, he's a rather fragile man, to be fair
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oddly enough, fire doesn't mix well with most scourge. it's less a matter of weakness and more that bolvar wasn't concerned whether he was successful or not.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the scourge are as hostile as ever, just... more tightly reigned in. at least for now. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the "for now" part is what concerns me.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's... what i'm trying to hold off. at least until the legion's defeated.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and in many ways, it was the lack of being reigned it that, ironically, kept the scourge from being much worse than it was
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: true, one could cause much more damage to the world; but one could also fight against it, argue for the sake of not killing quite so indiscriminantly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: in subtle ways, of course, but... still
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: nordaras, i'm aware that we had very different experiences in the scourge, but i don't...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know how you can say that arthas' scourge somehow wasn't killing indiscriminately 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not... not that maybe you didn't try to suggest things, or that the scourge was rampaging with no control. i know that's not true. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and not that bolvar's recent actions don't make him just as formidable of an opponent with only slightly different problems
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but i was sent into towns with the entire purpose of killing indiscriminately. that's what the entire invasion of quel'thalas was. that's what new avalon was. unless i've just completely misunderstood you, which.. which i won't rule out
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i wouldn't put quel'thalas and new avalon in the same category, because different people were steering. i guess my point is that we can't keep solving this issue with stopgap measures. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no matter how valiantly the chosen paladin fights, there's nothing to be done for it. we can keep killing the man on the throne, but that doesn't do anything about the lich king, really.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and the only reason bolvar is up there is *because* that's the closest thing to keeping the scourge from destroying everything.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wasn't that the whole point of it?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what happened, what's still happening, it's awful. there's no denying that. but a huge amount of the damage the scourge did was before arthas became the lich king.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: until we find some way to get at the root of the problem and simply wipe out everything in one fell swoop... it seems like that's as good as it gets. that was the *good* result. that was the scourge being restrained.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it was. and you're right, 100%. whatever solution we think we've found is temporary, at best, and putting off an even bigger problem, at worst. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't have a solution, and neither do you, or we wouldn't have a problem to begin with. all i know is that we can't fight the scourge and the legion at once. i'm just... trying to put it off even more, which might just make things worse in the long run.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it probably already has. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that's not entirely on you to solve.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it sure feels like it. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that, i believe, is an issue for all of us. but, as you said, not right now. the legion is still up there.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just... surely a fallen titan with an infinite army is a bigger threat than one man on a cold chair. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do believe so, yes. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do you know how many times i had to use my fire magic to get arthas unstuck from that damn thing? i hate that chair. thoroughly impractical.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that... is an image i'm glad to have 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's not even a chair! it's just a slightly chiseled ice block! that's not furniture! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, it's not!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you have enough power to get an army to build you a castle out of saronite but you can't make yourself a new chair? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's just impractical. and those stairs! walking down them when the wind picks up is a real hazard.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm surprised you didn't blow away 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i very nearly did, a handful of times
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i was a bit worried about thal during that final fight with arthas-- the wind picked up and i was sure he was gone 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, yes, he is very aerodynamic
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just... a kite made of robes 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you said that once already, you hack
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's a reason arthas had those chambers that were downstairs, and actually inside
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: after i had a particularly close call, i insisted we meet down there, instead
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it just seems like a much nicer place
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not that saronite is particularly warm, but it's not ice, i guess
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and not windy 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it really is. was, i guess. i immagine it's been abandoned for some time, after the little cavein incident
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i assume you had something to do with that
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it... was a group effort, to be fair
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, yes, there was a small group of you, wasn't there
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: there's no reason we couldn't stop by, if you really wanted to see it again
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i appreciate the sentiment, but i'm not sure i want to
Kelahnias nods at you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's a lot of memories, good and bad, in that place
Kelahnias creates: Healthstone.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: more good than bad, i suppose, but it is what it is
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it is. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: (im gonna.... go get some food real quick but then if u wanna do the other dungeons and do some Ghost Shit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: )
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have...... teriyaki chicken and veggies...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the closer to the devourer's chambers we can get, the better
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose even in the chambers would technically work
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we want to give these demons as little leeway to escape as possible
Kelahnias dances with Soulguard Bonecaster.
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias thanks you.
Kelahnias makes a rude gesture at Lady Sylvanas Windrunner.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, warchief. we have business right now, if you could, how do i say this, get out of here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would get your blades ready, just in case something goes horribly wrong and one of these things posesses me
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that... wouldn't be great. it'd be a shame to have to stab you after we've come so far.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: unless you're looking to get your soul stuck in frostmourne, i guess 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that does still somewhat accomplish what i was going for here
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: still, doesn't seem like the best outcome 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: still, just-- please do this. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have no more desire to lose my free will again than you do.
Kelahnias nods at you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, here goes nothing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn prepares an elaborate ritual.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and here... we... go!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: did it... work
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that was rather anticlimactic, i'd say
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose that means the souls are somewhere in here
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: very effective
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't feel particularly posessed, do you?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no more than usual
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: perfect! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: now, for the transfer, i believe the halls of reflection may be the best place to make the transfer
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you.. said you didn't exactly want to go back there 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not that i mind. just, if you're sure. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, but... most of the time that arthas and i spent together was spent in those halls. i believe that whatever is left of the man he was-- the part i'm going to transfer--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that memory is strongest, at least for me, in those halls. i imagine it might be for him, as well-- he had the throne room built to mimic the one in lordaeron
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there, i have a better chance of avoiding getting the lich king, and instead getting the fallen prince of lordaeron, if that makes sense to you
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it makes plenty of sense to me. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not that you have to justify yourself to me. i'll go wherever you say. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that's a new one.
Kelahnias shrugs at you.  Who knows?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't think there's any reason to cut through the pit of saron, unless you particularly want to. i have my own ways of entering arthas' private chambers, obviously, and presumably, bolvar has had no reason to go messing with them.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i just want one less voice in my head, that's all. how you do it is up to you. though i'm operating on the assumption you're not trying to lure me somewhere to stab me, which seems a little rude and counterproductive, so. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't think that would be a fight i would win, kel. and, besides, i am currently more or less unarmed. i have no need of a staff to cast most spells, of course, but they're weaker without a focus.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose i could attempt to beat you over the head with it?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that seems exceptionally uncalled for. and i thought we had a connection....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you're a very funny man sometimes, frostlord
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i guess when you spend most of your time with azeroth's sassiest elf you're bound to pick up a bit of humor eventually 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, i didn't realize you've been spending time with alecea!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i do happen to share an apartment with her 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, there you go!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: she did mention that to me in passing, i think
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but have you ever seen lorsaen trying to talk to someone he doesn't like? he's unstoppable
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how has cohabitation with thalanor been going for you? he's prone to, ah, nesting, if i recall correctly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, no, i shall have to see him in practice. size up the competition for sass, of course.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think i've nearly killed him no less than four times and it's equally horrifying every time 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, yes, the old hiding under blankets and books trick?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes!! and alecea and lorsaen decorated everything with "red" as the color theme so he.. he blends in! i can't see him!!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, no
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not to mention how many pairs of glasses we've lost 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and by lost i mean crushed 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that sounds like a good way to get shards of glass in your feet
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: somehow we've managed to avoid that so far
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so crushing thalanor to death is a constant fear, and then there was a period of time where i think he and alecea smuggled aethas sunreaver into the city, who is also apparently prone to curling up in a ball on the floor, and don't even get me started--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sounds very stressful
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i live in constant fear of accidentally crushing at least one of azeroth's most powerful mages 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, maybe don't wear heavy armor at home, then
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i speak from experience of being, well, not stepped on, but definitely a little squished
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: listen, most of the time it's me either walking into my home or trying to walk out of it, 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i feel like not sleeping on the floor is a really easy solution to this problem
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the real issue is the man has no fear 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he has to have something in common with his brother, i suppose
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he's about as heavy as a paperweight and completely devoid of any sense of self-preservation
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know enough about his brother to say, i guess, but it wouldn't surprise me 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: arithnan weighs more, but definitely also has zero self-preservation
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's a demon hunter
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: which says it all, i think
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that seems pretty self-explanatory 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mm, yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well. here we are.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's so odd, it's been years, and yet-- it still looks the same.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not much reason for it to change, is there? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, i guess not.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: anyway! let's get this over with, then.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: by all means 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it should be easier with a soul that's willing to be transferred
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: here we go!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... well?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: is he gone on your end?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn glances around.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i guess. the better question: is he there on yours? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn freezes, with his eyes wide.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn breathes a small sigh of relief. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: then i believe we'll both be much happier 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- oh. i need to-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... yes? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i should. get back home. so i'm not sitting somewhere talking to myself--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: by all means, nordaras 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn stares into what appears to be empty air.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ....i missed you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sorry, you were saying something?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... just that i can leave if you'd like
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm much less interesting to talk to anyways, i'm sure 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh-- i-- ah. no, i don't feel any need to stay here, of all places. we should get back to dalaran.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank you, kel.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this-- this means a lot to me.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i-- you really did all the work, but you're welcome. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you told me what was happening, and you let me do this. that's all that matters to me.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: listen, i.. it's better for all parties involved, is all. and nobody should have to be alone if they don't have to be. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank you. for understanding, and for letting me do this.
Kelahnias bows before you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, as you can most likely see, arthas' soul has had a rather interesting effect on the staff
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... a much better color than green, to be sure 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, certainly.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not certain how i'm going to explain it to everyone, but it's a marked improvement.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe they'll be too concerned with other things to notice? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: once again, i cannot thank you enough. this has made me happier than you could understand.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do hope so.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.. i'm glad i could help. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i appreciate it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i won't keep you any longer, kel. you've done so much for me. go, ah, enjoy your freedom. i'm certain there's plenty of things that you would like to do that will be easier without someone looking over your shoulder.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's quite an insinuation
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'll have you know storing frostmourne in a broom closet was never easier 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've set lorsaen a few potions that might aid with that situation as well, frostlord.
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do have fun!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm sure he would be.... most appreciative 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, i'm sure both of you will be
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *ahem* 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: be well, nordaras 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and yourself, frostlord.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn left channel.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: !!!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hell yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, i should.... probably not
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: arithnan, can i tell you something?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: fully confidential, you must understand
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: can we go somewhere that's less in the middle of the street?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you may notice that my weapon is no longer fel green
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and is, in fact, slightly crusted over with ice
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank you! i like it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the reason for this is that i removed the demon sould from it-- safely, don't worry about them being loose--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and, arithnan, i got my hands on-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: on arthas' soul.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- arithnan, i have him back.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: please don't die.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can see him and speak to him but he can't interact with anything, or anyone else
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, it was quite tricky
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he says hello, by the way
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm certain there's ways for him to be, perhaps, more useful. or at least more visible. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes. i'm very happy.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn glances to the side.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: love, this is arithnan, he flirts on instinct. he understands that it's all in good fun.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose you can speak for yourself
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he simply can't respond, i suppose
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wanted to get both of you in the loop, so you don't think i'm suddenly being unkind, and he doesn't think i'm trying to lose him. not after everything i went through to get him back.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wonderful! i hoped you would take this in stride.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i appreciate it. besides, you have your own people, don't you? erileas, at least, hmm?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, not as far as anyone else is concerned
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it just means that i'm happier and have a less dangerous staff.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, i understand.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well. i just-- wanted to check in, arithnan. you've been a good friend to me, and i wanted to make sure nobody got caught off guard, or had their feelings too badly hurt.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn awkwardly gives Arithnan a side-hug.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, we certainly do
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hey, stranger 
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're not wrong 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's the problem though, isn't it? shit's Always busy 
Kelahnias gently pats Taffy.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it feels like the world's been trying to end itself for the past five years 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no breaks! maybe it just hates us, in particular 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah, well, i'm not counting the time i was trying to end the world 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ghh, maybe 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i just feel like azeroth's been getting more desperate since the whole time-traveling orcs thing 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: nobody knows, but we'll probably have to kill it! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's ridiculously stupid 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: what good is a rock to live on if it keeps trying to kill you 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: or did kill you, i guess 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i dunno. it's like, lich king? bad. real awful. but like, our own problem, y'know? and we fixed it. sort of. but then we've got time traveling orcs and magic old gods and weird corrupted titans traveling all the way across the universe just to kill us--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: in particular
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's fucked up, is what it is 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe, for once, i'd like to just stay home! take a nap! go out to dinner! something normal people do! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do you think those weird faceless arm wiggly boys played catch with arthas' heart while they were down there 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, maybe? where else would you put it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... i'd like to go to dinner with you, too. or like, without feeling guilty about it, at least. but then, i couldn't even really do that, because i can't even eat anything! it's pointless! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i feel like there's just something too generic about putting it on the floor. what if it gets lost 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... i don't know 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know that pretending's exactly the same thing. besides, i'd end up giving you my meal like i always do and you know it
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i feel like he's probably doing more important things than thinking about whether old gods know how to organize things 
Kelahnias frowns.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: be careful or all these compliments will go straight to my head 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but i-- well, you know how i managed to sort of patch things up with nordaras? and he made like.. a complete 180 with how he would talk to me, and he's really not all that bad, i guess, but i..
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, we had this idea, right? because arthas' dumb and awful ghost was still trapped in frostmourne, you know, and it was awful. but we thought, maybe, we could figure out a way to get his dumb ghost out of my awful swords and instead put it in his staff
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's sounds convoluted 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, i guess it is. he did all the calculations and magic and whatnot and i just kind of, showed up.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: uhh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we took arthas out of frostmourne and stuck him in nordaras' weird demon staff thing
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: listen i don't.. i don't know how any of that shit works 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he seemed... really happy. like, legitimately so. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... hope nothing. i don't know. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i guess it can be another problem i have to deal with if it goes south, but he seemed.. sincere. in that way you miss someone you love. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen,
Kelahnias frowns with disappointment at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i just.. are you trying to tell me he might try to fuck a ghost??? because, like, that's impossible. you can't fuck a ghost. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, but i've been around enough ghosts that--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: y'know, sometimes i hate you
Kelahnias looks at you and covers his face with his palm.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: honestly, i don't want to know, and i don't want to try 
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.. yeah. it's a little less stressful to not have to see a ghost all the time. cuts back on the panic attacks. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and hopefully i won't.. fall down any stairs again any time soon 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it was painful, too!! that staircase was... long. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm... not sure of how much an actual issue that was, lorsaen, but you.. don't have to worry about it anymore, i guess?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i feel like there were plenty of other things that could've been more awkward 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think i would assume that he was not, in fact, blowing a kiss at me 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's not like you physically kissed him!!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and, uh, those are... i mean, i guess they came with instructions, or whatever 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm.. a little concerned that nordaras may know too much about our sex life? i'm just. he came up with that idea completely on his own unless you were complaining to him, or something. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: please don't say that again 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and i just really don't see how that's worse. do you have a problem with waving to the wrong person on the street that often?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... what 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: why are you waving at silvermoon guards in the first place??? how many do you know????
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i feel like a master spy such as yourself should be able to tell a few guards apart
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i bet the postmaster opens up all sorts of personal letters. i bet he gets a kick from it. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: highly suspicious 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: like some kind of mail demon 
Kelahnias looks at you with a confused look.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think he just enjoys gossip, lorsaen 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: with that logic alecea could be the mail guy, too 
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just because they enjoy reading doesn't mean they're somehow stealing everyone's mail
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: y'know that's almost a little frightening 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: like, just, that you're in charge, 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but i mean. so am i, which might be worse given my current track record 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do you sit around a table and like, whisper at each other all secret-like in meetings?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, i've got a story for you-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i was talking to nordaras, as i said, but this was before the whole ghost swapping thing. this was me trying to apologize for being rude to him all the time.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn clears his throat. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: anyways, as it turns out, he thought i was *his* age. like, well over 200. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean i feel like it's easier to be compromised if you don't whisper, y'know? you should try it. gotta keep up your security, don't get too complacent. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah. i mean, i didn't want to lie to the guy, because it doesn't matter all that much, right? we're all adults, y'know? but i think he felt, like... legitimately bad about the fact i was so much younger than him. like he'd been bullying a child--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: or something.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sounds like you fit in great, dear
Kelahnias's shoulder.
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: what, am i wrong? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're the one dating a death knight, after all 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not that it's bad! you're weird in the most lovable way 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'd probably be dead somewhere in northrend if it weren't for you-- so i'm definitely not complaining 
Kelahnias blows you a kiss.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: exactly! think of all the scenery i could've missed 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, mac'aree was very lovely 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i bet xe'ra would've hated me rubbing my dead hands all over everything on that ship 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: still, it sounds like your super secret meetings are much better than my only mildly secret meetings 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, like, picture this. so me, taalle, and slackjaw are all deathlords, yeah? except taalle doesn't care and slackjaw's usually unintelligible and also doesn't care about, like, typical meeting stuff, y'know? so then i have to try and talk to everybody.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and no one else really cares, either, because they'd rather be out killing things. it's a mess. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm glad you got that whole thing sorted out with him being impersonated by a demon, it seems like you two get along alright 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the fact that you think that would help is hilarious to me 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, i guess, i'm just afraid something bad might happen to whatever poor sap tries to give an order of death knights advice
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, uh, speaking of death knights, i was talking to your mother recently and she, uh-- had a few words for me 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and i know everything's super busy and the world is ending and i might be completely doomed as far as this whole bolvar situation goes, but she really keeps insisting that i'm doing you a horrible injustice because we haven't, y'know, gotten married yet--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: or anything and i dunno if there's a right time or anything but i just, y'know, thought i'd.. ask? if that's alright with you? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, no, i mean, sometimes she says.. other things, but this one comes up a bit. she's a very insistent woman. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, i don't know! i just thought that if we're going to get annihilated by sargeras and the entire burning legion next week, it might be nice to at least be... married before it happens? 
Kelahnias blushes.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just... you know, if you want. it's not, like, a requirement or anything that'd be ridiculous-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and i don't.... have a ring. or anything romantic planned or... well. yeah. it was just a thought. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.... you're sure? 
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias hugs you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.... i guess? probably? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: or we could... i don't know. maybe we could get, like, technically married, but then have the actual wedding if we manage to, well, not die during this whole legion ordeal
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... you're absolutely right. she's bound to know something. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... maybe you're right. it doesn't much matter to me, just as long as i get to be with you, i suppose 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... do you know what this means? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're my *fiance.* how fancy does that sound. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean i... guess so, yeah. it'd be ridiculous to get married in armor. i just.. i dunno, i look silly in suits. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, i'll always make an exception for you
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he looked at you funny, i agree
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that sounds fake, but okay 
Kelahnias points at Gelanthis.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean i guess it makes more sense if you get to pick out your own ring, right?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so that it, like, fits, and you actually like the design! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i have... no taste.
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, you can't really wear them with gloves, can you?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: of course i.. i think that's very sweet 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's ridiculously sappy but i want you to know that i love it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i have no idea what you're talking about, i've never been sappy a day in my life. not once. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ...?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... i mean i.. hadn't thought about that, i guess. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: did you.. have a feeling, one way or the other? personally it doesn't matter to me, either way. it seems like we could both keep our names if we wanted to, you know? alecea seems to do that rather frequently. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i-i mean if.. if that's what you want, i... 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know how much of a ring it has to it, but it is very likely to make me cry, so you'll have to be prepared for that 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... you know i love you, right? just. more than anything. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not... not nearly as lucky as i am. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... of course
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we really do have... a lot of people to tell, don't we?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: practice makes perfect, dear
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i feel like the answer to that has got to be 'yes' 
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'll, ah, go.. sit on a bench outside for a bit, then. we can head back to dalaran when you're done, maybe? 
Kelahnias blows you a kiss.
Kelahnias bows before you.
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... love you, too.
Kelahnias waves at you.
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias blows you a kiss.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so many of those things just seem to end in shouting fests and we're literally in the same place we started
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: a waste of time, mostly
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: they're very good at that
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm a little jealous
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, me yelling at people never seems to have the intended result, so, yes, i guess
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hmm, maybe 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know, me yelling at people either comes off as too intimidating to be helpful, or just gets other people to yell at me back. it's a tough balance. people just assume i'm in a constant state of almost snapping on somebody so it just... doesn't work
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're right, but i think in general no one really wants to listen to a death knight 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: which is fine, i guess. i like standing in the back and looking all scary without being obligated to say anything 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm fairly certain you do that, anyways, and they might catch on if there were two of us 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'd like to remind you who you're always leaning up against during those meetings, lorsaen 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: your secret's safe with me, but if someone hears you snoring i can't be held responsible 
Kelahnias laughs.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, not particularly, but there's no telling when someone decides to start being perceptive 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: why are you wielding an oversized fork
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he gots wings AND a gun?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: arthas must have HATED us. we never got anything cool. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: now i'm imagining a gheist with a shotgun
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think invincible has Earned a gun at this point
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we could figure something out!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.. i guess you're right
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it'd still be cool, though
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh no
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but then they'd have to, like, balance on just one foot.. talon?? and that looks uncomfortable
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, the hawkstriders! 
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: are you telling me you could shoot a gun with your foot?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hmm, maybe
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... i can pick my socks up with my feet
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: have you ever seen, like, a picture of someone trying to fire a bow with their feet? i managed to pull that off exactly once
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: really! the, uh, result wasn't that great, but i technically did it! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... i mean i haven't done it in a long time, y'know? probably don't even know how, anymore
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i have hobbies!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: besides that doesn't mean i could do it... well
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i collect swords, too. that two whole hobbies.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i know how to bake, too! that's so many hobbies.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the rest of azeroth can deal with their swordlessness and take some time to think about what they've done
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the problem with felo'melorn is it's just so... mage-y. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: around the swords! that adds to the aesthetic of it all
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i really want to know
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ooh, that's a good idea
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but now you've got me thinking about bows and like... it's not quite as impressive as the whole feet thing, but i would, like, hang upside-down off a treebranch and fire and i was so much better at that trick--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i always thought it was fun! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i couldn't tell you how many hours i practiced with that stupid thing, just to try and prove that i could 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: exactly! 
Kelahnias blows you a kiss.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn left channel.
Kelahnias leaves the party.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you've gotten new robes, thalanor! they're very flattering.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i see you're still fond of those gloves
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm glad they're being put to good use
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i will keep my eyes open, thalanor
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mm, yes. they do blend in quite well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, yes, well. i had tried to blend in a bit more with the horde's forces in draenor, when i was there, and just stuck with the same armor
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: some of the craftmanship there is quite clever, the things they can do with fur. but, ah, if i am to meet my end at the legion's hands, i would like to do it looking like myself
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and, of course, who knows who one might meet in karazhan, of all places!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've stared at this tower so many times in my travels, wondering what secrets might be hidden inside, what might be going on within... even in this state, it's awfully exciting to be here at all!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: your wife may end up needing to send someone to retrieve us
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: here, or in general? or, i suppose, both
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that is quite the, um, dress you've just picked up there
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's a very odd shade, and it has a little bow on the front
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not that i don't think you could wear bows, but it's a very oddly shaped garment
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose if you wished to accentuate your bust it would do that very nicely
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it's always an option, now, isn't it?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: who says i haven't already?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes, but you can certainly broaden your horizons, as well
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't expect you not to be, but many people find it enjoyable for recreational purposes, or just dressing up for the sake of dressing up
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: in some more metropolitan areas, it's almost an art form
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, i can see that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it does seem rather up his alley
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wonder who these busts were meant to be of
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no inscriptions on them, how annoying
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: art, i suppose. but art without history. how uninteresting.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: for what it's worth, i have at least somewhat attempted to convince him to speak with you and alecea in a less hostile manner than he tends towards
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah! another of these awful busts
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- well. yes, i suppose you're right.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he-- i don't know, thal. i know that he hurt both you and alecea, but he has been a surpringly good friend to me in the past few months. i don't know what to say about him. what conclusions to draw.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i rarely assume that any of my relationships of any kind will last
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do as well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, of course not, but it does mean that i am less deterred by the notion
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the architecture of this place is deeply unsettling
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i say this as a man who has studies the ruins of ahn'qiraj
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: which were, as you may recall, built by insects, and thoroughly corrupted by old gods
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if it turned out that this place was built with arcane magic by a very drunk medivh, i would not be surprised
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they are BURNING the BOOKS
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ugh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooh, there's a vial over here still bubbling. i do wonder what's inside...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i found skulls!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and all kinds of exciting bubbly beakers and vials, ohoho
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not sure, they're just on this table here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it does seem like some kind of inexplicable mass extinction that left a number of undead
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i have no clue what caused it, or why these people were here in the first place! was this medivh's doing, maybe, to open the portal?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you would think the sacrifice would have occured a bit closer to the gate itself
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he seemed to be throwing parties, he could have just closed the doors, couldn't he?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm. i suppose i did consider throwing a few fireballs when my mother's guests stuck around too long
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, here's something
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: these books are as large as i am!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: maybe medivh was a very large man?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, me either
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, we have demons, a singular titan construct, and now ethereals?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: medivh's parties must have been very good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what is... happening
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oooh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's very far up there
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i cannot determine the gender of the person in this portrait, but they are wearing a very interesting robe
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what bath robe has a hood?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: their face is shadowed but their incredibly smooth chest is fully exposed
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's something, that's for sure
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thalanor, do take a look skyward
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there seems to be something rather odd afoot here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can't say i've had the pleasure of visiting, but i can take your word for it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it almost feels like if you stare too long you might start falling
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, don't tempt me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would love to take notes comparing the two, it sounds like a lovely holiday after all of this
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do wish we had had more time in draenor, just to study the place
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not particularly, no
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not much of a strategist, but i suppose we can certainly take a crack at it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do you wish to steer blackhand, or shall i?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: go for it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think i'll be better suited to a warlock, anways
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what did he DO
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh my dude died
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: why is llane indestructible
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okay so get healers first this time i guess
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okay i can do that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, when i said i was bad at chess, now you know i was not lying
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: eurgh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: these so-called "fleshbeasts"-- what kind of flesh are they even MADE of
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was part of the scourge, i've seen all kinds of horrible flesh creatures
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but at least those had identifiable parts!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i definitely prefer his jello to these things
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: OH/
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this is new
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: all of this here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wonder where we even are at this point
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: clearly no longer on the same plane of reality
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's a skeletal gryphon down there
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it almost looks like there's just more and more rocky shapes up into the sky
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they look... directed
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: like they're coming out from something, hm?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and that structure over there, do you suppose it's just broken rock? because it looks almost like it has... teeth
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mmm, perhaps. it seems plausible that part of the tower would have broken off and fallen through the initial entrypoint
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, now you're just tempting me! i'm certain only painful death would await through such a portal, but still... how curious
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't think i want to do that, either
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what if they didn't return, or got turned into sludge?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: unfortunately, i believe you're right
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, i believe we have enough for everyone to have a shot at accidentally destroying everything or unleashing horrible powers
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, shall we return to dalaran?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: before your wife sends out a rescue party, you mean
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, no, of course not
Kelahnias greets you with a hearty hello!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and how are you doing this... perfectly mediocre tuesday?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: all this time and i'm still not entirely sure what triggers those
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but if sometimes only one of them activates, or even none of them, what's the point??
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but then... what's the point of having traps to begin with
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it... does?
Kelahnias gently pats Taffy.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's all relative 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe we should think of better traps
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that'd have to be a big sock puppet
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: an even BIGGER box 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, i...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: listen, if it's where you want to have it, then that's where we'll have it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ideally it will make for some lovely pictures and we'll-- i'll-- be far too busy in the moment to really notice, you know? and either way, it's still home, which feels... fitting? i don't know if that's the right word. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sure, I... yes, lorsaen, i think it will work perfectly, and all the better if it's a spot you really want 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: besides, i refuse to let the scourge five years in the past dictate where i will have my wedding. if you want it on quel'danas, we'll have it on quel'danas
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: surely the lord regent himself wouldn't think of standing in the way of true love 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: aww
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not sure why i'd need to--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen i'm quite certain you have much better taste in, well, everything than i do. i trust your judgement 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm.. having a hard thinking of how you could possibly make me uncomfortable
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: like, you manage to pick a flower arrangement that i simply can't stand? what are the chances of that?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: fine, dear, i will happily sign off on all of your choices if it will make you feel better
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but i should hope you know that i trust you implicitly
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ah, uhm. right. we have to do that. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hmm. do you have anyone in mind for yourself?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen, you always tell me i should be making more friends. i might have to start giving you the same advice
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, there are a good number of people you've known longer than me, i believe 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... feel like slackjaw is the most obvious choice for myself, personally. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: is there a particular reason why you don't talk to them? i... hope i haven't been infringing on your friendships, somehow 
Kelahnias laughs.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: truthfully i'm sure she'll be perfectly fine 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not entirely sure those would really count as friends, then, dear. more like people on my hit list. feeding the eternal hunger and all that. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, it's... always a work in progress, yes? honestly, our biggest problem might be that we mostly know all the same people 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and besides, i'll have you know i'm very close with slackjaw! have you seen his motorcycle? who would want to be bffs with the owner of that? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hey, it's--
Kelahnias hugs you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry, dear. i know that can't be easy. 
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we'll figure something out though, yeah? i'm certain if you asked thalanor, he wouldn't say no.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, it's still not fair to you, is all. you deserve the world. and, y'know, a best friend. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: multiple friends, actually. as many good friends as you could handle.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you know, you make an excellent point. who needs best men? we can be our own best men. and the grooms. we'll just do everything, no problem.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the world should fear you! i mean, love you. the world should love you. and be your friend, because you deserve it.
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias blushes at you.
Kelahnias blows you a kiss.
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: are you.... are you suggesting that you ask lord regent lor'themar theron to be your best man
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn thinks for a moment.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i feel like... maybe you should make him wear a silly outfit for the actual wedding. just ask that he wear a silly outfit for a bachelor party, or something. those are things, right? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: besides, me and quite possibly the entirety of the ebon blade will theoretically be wearing suits. that feels like a satisfactory amount of silly outfits for the wedding
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i am certainly going to try, dear
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen, i do believe you are regularly very capable at getting me out of my armor
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you are.. a surprisingly easy man to please 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: this was actually my intention all along, of course. to stubbornly keep my armor on for the first few years, just to lower your expectations
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen, please, not in front of the child
Kelahnias falls asleep. Zzzzzzz.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen, there are very fews things in this world that would not be somehow improved by doing them with you 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm.. i'm just saying! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: worm!!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i believe in you
Kelahnias cheers at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen i hit my head on the dock :(
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank you!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i take halloween very seriously
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: good to know 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there is no thumbs up in this
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: elivan, any excuse to dress up and cause a bit of mischief has my name all over it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm dead too, so it's fine
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yeah, it happens
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this guy stole your look!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooh, that's a lovely view
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do so adore these mountains
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: snowy mountains and absolutely nothing beyond but the knowledge of the sea
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've certainly found snow quite conducive to that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mhmm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and the architecture here!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it reminds me of the storm peaks, in a way
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the mogu and pandaren practically rival the titans for the beauty of their buildings
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: these are libraries!!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i could spend years in this one room alone....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it looks like there are clouds within, doesn't it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do pop that bad boy on, would you, elivan?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how delightful! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would hate to see you down a dark alley, i'll tell you that much
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, it's perfect!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: tis the season, after all!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you did very well!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do have a creepier costume, of course, but this one made alecea laugh, so i... stuck with this, for now
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i haven't been this excited in ages!!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it makes me look like the kind of madman you would *expect* to find in icecrown
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it makes me look like a mean, deviant scarecrow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this is--! oh, i do love titan vaults...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how fascinating!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but there are changes here to accomodate the culture of pandaria
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how did they move them?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have become a human
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what did u roll on it?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: YOU CAN'T *USE* THEM UNTIL YOU DO THE QUESTS
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: welp, i guess i did say i wanted to come back here w nordaras
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wait it did let me unlock it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess we can..... check when we get outsite
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: outside
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bc most serpents u cant even unlock
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yeah, esp for a raid?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you know, eli
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: elivan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do wonder about these mogu and their relationship with the titans
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: considering that they do seem to be made of stone
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, well, between sargeras and how the titans' creations carry on, i don't think the titans were that great
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've heard about the nonsense in ulduar, having to stop the titans from completely destroying the world
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: just because the old gods gave everyone flesh!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: northrend seems like a bad place to be
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i mean, i did go there, but i also enjoy tracking down bad energy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wonder if it was coincidence that the lich king arrived there, or if the old god-- yogg-saron, yes?-- had something to do with it?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it just makes me wonder. if my studies of history have taught me anything, it's that there are precious few coincidences.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but, i suppose we're unlikely to be able to ask any old gods any time soon
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im afraid none of them have dropped in to give me calling cards
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: quite the tragedy
Nordaras, Delver of the Vaults'.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: does lorewalker cho... want a rundown on the titans?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm sure we could call in that dwarf
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: whose name i have unfortunately forgotten
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that one! yes. what i would give to sit down and chat with that man...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: really? where?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...why?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, that darling creature you ride around?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how fascinating! i had no idea that it was the work of the titans, i assumed it was the night elves
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, no! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that's concerning
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the movement of this creature is slightly nauseating
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i am not one to get seasick
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well. that was... certainly an adventure.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: shall we return to dalaran, then?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: understandable, carry on 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... would you like it, then?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: unfortunately i'm not sure i have much time to get bored at all, arla 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i suppose you're right, though i'm not sure i would resort to a puzzle ring in case of boredom
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: really, if you think they're neat, you should have it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you think they're that interesting, then?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'll admit i'm not sure i see the appeal
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well i... suppose that's true
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oddly enough, it makes perfect sense that you and nordaras are so close
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if i had two gold for every time someone called me 'mortal,' do you know how rich i would be?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: 'people' is a good starter 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, yes, i'm quite aware. night elves act much the same way, and they're not even immortal anymore
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and you think calling everyone you meet 'mortal' isn't?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: 'mortal' is what you call someone when you want to show off that you're somehow better than them, and also that you can probably kill them if you wanted to
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: arla, you talk more of your inherent duty as a dragon to guard the world more than any other dragon i have ever met, with perhaps some of the aspects as an exception
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, the other blue dragons, malygos included, decided to take that purpose and try to wipe out everyone else for using magic. i believe you've earned a bit of slack regarding your purpose at this point. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and i'm not trying to be rude, but just because you happen to be a dragon doesn't mean you are somehow better than the rest of us, or that you somehow owe azeroth more than we do. we're all on this planet. we all have a purpose to safeguard it.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and how many dragons have gone completely insane over the years? how many titan constructs are trying to wipe out the entirety of azeroth? maybe be so focused on what you think you were created to do isn't the best state of mind. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, you may want to work on that just a bit, with the phrasing and all. and i'm.. not trying to tell you what you should or shouldn't do, but you seem to be defeating yourself before you've even started in terms of relating to people  
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't have much in common with a draenei, but that doesn't mean i can't find some way to relate to them
Kelahnias laughs.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if only the titans had built better filtration systems 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: guess not 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: not sure i'd even want to, honestly 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, there's plenty of things i could say. that doesn't mean i want to talk to them 
Kelahnias.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, word travels between myself and alecea
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... that's fair
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: she did seem pretty excited 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's a very exciting thing! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it is!! it's just kind of funny that so many other people are so interested, i guess 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: why wouldn't they be? there's precious little good news these days, after all.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and lorsaen is this weird mix of ecstatic and nervous, like he thinks things have to change somehow just because we're married, and i'm just not entirely sure.. why that would be the case 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: like, he's invited people over to brunch because we have to start doing married couple things and apparently that's something married couples do?? it's weird 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, well, that is a thing that happens sometimes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: at least, in my experience, married couples do that, although it may have just been the people i knew.
Kelahnias shrugs at you.  Who knows?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: having people over is a relatively normal thing to do, when you aren't stopping the end of the world every three minutes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but, well. it's obvious to see that you two make each other happy, and that is worth celebrating.
Kelahnias pets Sol.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's... nice. to have something good. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and lorsaen has been my one good thing for a very long time
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and for a long time to come, i should hope
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i just.. didn't mean to make him worry about so many other things by proposing, y'know? because holy shit there are so many things that go into a wedding, nordaras, 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, there certainly are.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's excessive!!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: one of my sisters once burst into tears while trying to decide the precise shade of cream she wanted for the parchment that would be used for the invitations
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's just so many decisions
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's SO many decisions
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the biggest problem is i don't care about any of it! it makes no difference what color the invitations are. or what the flowers look like. or what everyone's *wearing* 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: of course it doesn't matter! unless it does, of course, and therein lies the real question
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ..... what 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: all of the trappings and formalities are meaningless unless they mean something to you, personally
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the question is, does lorsaen care about these things because he's suddenly very occupied with what others think of him?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or does he care about these things because having the "perfect wedding" matters to him?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... i don't know. i.. would hope more of the latter, but that doesn't exactly help 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the problem is that as long as lorsaen is there i've got my perfect wedding. i'm just not sure what makes it perfect for him, and that's what matters
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: have you asked him?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you... make a good point 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm certain you two already know the importance of communication, but especially at a time like this
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're right, it's just.. a bit difficult to communicate when my biggest opinion of what the flowers look like is 'whichever you love the most,' partially because he seems absolutely terrified he'll somehow pick something i hate 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we'll figure it out, to be sure. it's just.. so much more planning than i was anticipating 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we haven't even finished the *guest lists* yet. i don't even know how we know this many people. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you've been fighting for a while, now, i think you know pretty much everyone
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sure, but it's weird! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: death knights aren't even supposed to have *friends*, and yet 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: kel, you have shown yourself repeatedly to not care one bit about what a death knight is "supposed" to do
Kelahnias lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sometimes i wish that were a bit more true 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, well,
Kelahnias smiles at Taffy.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes. anyway, shall we get on with whatever it is that the bronze dragonflight wants from us?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: as long as it's not stratholme again, hopefully it shouldn't be a problem 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: come again?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: don't... worry about it 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you've made me worried
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, lovely
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: really, it's nothing to worry about. just an unfortunate oversight by the bronze dragons, i think
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've never heard "oversight" and "bronze dragon" in the same sentence before
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it wasn't really, i guess. just.. no one thought that maybe it wasn't a good idea to send a death knight back to the culling of stratholme 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, that does seem like a terrible idea
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm surprised the timeline didn't somehow end up completely destroyed after that
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're not the only one. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but you haven't said anything about how you've been doing lately?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, well. busy, with the legion and whatnot, but better than i've been in quite some time. it's nice to not have the house completely to myself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and now i've figured out what the cats were going so haywire about, as well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can't thank you enough for letting me... thank you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i can imagine 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's... i'm glad it worked out
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: me too.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... what was wrong with the cats?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, cats are good at sensing any arcane or otherwise supernatural presences that most wouldn't percieve
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the ones that come with me kept getting annoyed whenever i interacted with you and i could never understand why, but i think it's that they were offended that arthas was refusing to pet them.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not that he would be capable of such a thing in his current state, obviously
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that... makes sense 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: spoiled babies, all of them
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: though i think that's not entirely true. if a ghost can manage to be corporeal enough to stab someone, i feel that they should be able to pet a cat somehow 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you would think.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: though i think arthas' ghost probably has a harder time. mostly because i'm not sure the entirety of him is.. actually there, if that makes sense. thus why no one else could see him. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just.. whatever fragment of him was stuck in frostmourne. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, i've started thinking that's the case as well. i can think of few other circumsances in which a person's soul could have become so fragmented
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's a bit of a unique situation
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it might be a bit of a scavenger hunt to try to get him put back together a bit more
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't particularly like the notion of leaving bits of soul floating about, untethered and vulnerable to be used by anyone for whatever purposes they wish
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: at least you know where i live. not that i have any ill intentions, of course.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i understand
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.. didn't say that you did 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i just like to clarify. i'm used to a good dose of suspicion where i'm concerned
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not all of which, i must admit, is undeserved
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: honestly at this point your track record may be better than mine 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if that's the case, you've been a busy man.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you could say that. though it's been a bit of a group effort i suppose
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: could try... dying and resetting 
Kelahnias gently pats Charnagma.
Kelahnias has died.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: bleeeehhh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not this again
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the joke is to go limp in the water and pretend you're dead
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's a pretty good joke
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's amazing how quickly people forget you're undead
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: wHAT HAPPENED HERE
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooooh noooooo i can't breaathe!!! whatever shall i do!!!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: haha, exactly! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm... a bit concerned about that poor frost wyrm up there
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what is he doing?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he just.. couldn't fly very fast at all
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they get tired sometimes
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... how, exactly, does an undead dragon get tired
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you would be surprised
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: doesn't that sort of defeat the purpose?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, probably
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: maybe someone cast a spell or something to slow him?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: all i know is that arla does enjoy a nap now and again
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, sure, but just because he enjoys a nap doesn't mean he needs one
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: true
Kelahnias has died.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what did you do
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... tripped
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i should have put you in a marble
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hey
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you're in a pile of leaves
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's comfy here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, we have to fight archimonde
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and personally i am very much looking forward to it, after what this bastard has pulled
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's fine 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he'll come back again it doesn't even matter 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: are you coming, or shall i fight him myself?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, but it's still satisfying
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: please do not finger me, archimonde
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... phrasing?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i know what i said
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: what did you just put on your head
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it was so hideous i had to check it
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's VERY hideous 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: enjoying the scenery?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: huh? i suppose. the night elves have never been particularly compelling to me, to be honest
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but these world trees, or whatever they're called, are quite striking
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you just seemed distracted, i thought you might be thinking about something, is all 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: they're... large 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.. i like trees as much as the next elf, but i think the night elves are just a bit excessive 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think the night elves like trees more than they like people
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think they like plenty of things more than they like people. it's kind of sad 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i wouldn't say they're a people known for their kindness, but they sure are quick to judge us 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they abandoned their own civilization because they didn't feel like trying to rebuild or stand with their own people
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and yet they return and claim to have such presence and precedence over everyone else, after hiding for so long!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's ridiculous 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well. this was a fun excursion, i think. getting the chance to set archimonde on fire a little bit has done wonders for my mood.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, that's no small feat 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: why do you have that?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... hallow's end 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i bought three cats
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and it's almost cute 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: a tiny necropolis 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's vomiting everywhere!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, that's just how it is sometimes! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: take it up with kel'thuzad and his poor design choices 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and really, no one could have ever predicted you buying nothing but cats 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am a man of habit. besides, how many people would honestly adopt a dead kitten?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: those who lack vision 
Kelahnias pets Widget.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, this has been lovely, but many miles to go before we sleep and all that
Kelahnias nods at you.
Kelahnias.  Farewell!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea! i am so excited to see you!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i do wish to explain something before we get underway, just in the interest of disclosure
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, you recall my conundrum with the souls within this staff, yes?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, yes, i was afraid that somehow the gods would ensure that my plans failed if i ever said them aloud
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the reason i was so worried about failing is that i managed to locate arthas' soul. or part of it, i suppose?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it's better than having an enormous number of demons in my staff.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hence the change in the appearance of the staff itself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i removed the demon souls, first!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't want to implicate anyone else in my decisions. yes, there were other factors and people involved in it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i'm not sure i could identify them without getting myself in trouble with more than just you, my friend.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's precisely what i'm afraid of! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think i'm more likely to survive your wrath than my... accomplice.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, alecea, don't do this to me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn looks pleadingly at empty space near his shoulder.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i did not personally track down arthas. it was kel who bumped into him first, doing whatever it is that he does with his free time.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wouldn't describe it as getting along well, just that he wanted arthas to stop bothering him, and i needed a soul!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea, i was... i was so scared that if i told anyone, if i did anything, if i got help from anyone, i would fail and he'd slip away again
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and besides, 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i know, alecea, i know, but i was-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess part of me was afraid that you'd try to stop me. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i couldn't let this chance slip away from me. if i failed and it was my own fault, then at least i could just hate myself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: normally i'm perfectly happy to spill other people's secrets, but that's because i've never really had friends other than you before!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i would also really not like for the deathlord to murder *me*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: any of them, really. one of them is a lost cause, one of them is a blank slate, and at least kel tolerates me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea, what is this really about?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: because you've never gotten mad at me for making *friends* before?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: a goblin? what compelled you to interact with a goblin?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...i deserve that, that's fair. what's this about a crush? i'm not sure i ever met mizra... i never had much contact with most of the death knights
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i'm certain arla handled it with very little grace?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, that sounds like him.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that sounds that something we can do something about.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: did you have more about this goblin you needed to get out of your system, before we get to plotting?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have a ghost at my disposal that i could unleash on him, if needed.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or, a third of a ghost.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that sounds like a waste of titan materials
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you absolutely deserve something for that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: when we get back to dalaran, i will buy you a very nice bottle of wine and sit next to you while you drink it so nobody thinks you're crazy.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: shall we? i'm half hoping that we will genuinely trip over some other part of arthas' soul while wandering around northrend
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, there is no accounting for taste.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think you're perfectly reasonable! i'm related to many of the pretentious ones, i know
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, because you don't like riding around in explosives?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it seems like a waste of something you could do perfectly good research on
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, what else am i here for!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you flatter me. anyone can have fashion sense if they have money.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm, well... i suppose you're right. but it does help...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes, you've met my mother
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: also, please do not be alarmed if you see a bit of a spectral sword appear. things are more complicated for part of a ghost, of course, but he does like to help, when he can.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, well, that's why i told you
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...yes? that's-- alecea, that's part of why i told you about him in the first place
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's been very dutifully pretending to be inspecting the stonework and not listening, if it makes you feel better.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, um.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sorry, i assumed you would-- figure it out.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he also thinks moebie was being ridiculous.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and he... would like you to know that he's very sorry, and that he's aware that that's not enough of an apology to make anything better.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i, well, yes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i just... wanted to relay the message.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think we're all aware that it's insignificant, against what you've lost. but... well, i can point out where he's standing, if you'd like to, uh, chat.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okay. you know where to find me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i mean, i'm still right here, but if you change your mind.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: later, i mean.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, how about the upcoming wedding? i've heard that you're helping with the planning, yes?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea, i think a goldshire bar fight would be more relaxing than argus, but i take your meaning
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh i-- i'm invited? i didn't realize--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess i won lorsaen over with my potions, or something?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i didn't realize they liked me *that* much
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i would hope they understand that i won't be offended if they leave me out. i may cry into my icecream, but i would never be *offended*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, well, i did solve his little ghost problem, i suppose
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no! the truth of it is, if i have more than one friend, i'll meeeeeelt!!!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: tell... the cats.... i... love..... them....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am outside
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: shhhh im melting
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but of course, alecea!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, there might be a few that he's more attached to.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mr. bigglesworth is a free spirit and should be allowed to be roam free until he decides on a new owner.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooh, that is a very good point! i suppose i'll need to actually wear something that isn't black
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes, but i'm not a death knight, am i? they have the excuse of not knowing.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes, but some of us still believe in fashion.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: excuse me?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's a lot going on there!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: brunch plus arithnan is weird enough as it is, brunch plus arithnan plus your home? blasphemy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, godspeed
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i tried that exactly once
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: for the fireproofing, or getting them to speak?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: don't let thal have any coffee without interacting with arithnan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that way, he has to do it, and he won't have the energy or alertness to set things on fire
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: will the sheer force of trying to be proper when he has houseguests not be enough?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, he'll definitely help.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's actually almost funnier than the idea of arithnan having brunch
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: erileas having brunch
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's just always so serious
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, true
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: brunch is the only excuse in polite society to drink during the day
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, i guess he doesn't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am too. he's been a surprisingly good friend to me, and i think we feel the same way about a great number of things. which, knowing me, is not a good thing.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i doubt thal had anything to do with whatever lead to him feeling that way, but... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well. i hope everything goes well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that would explain a lot, yes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do too, but i'm not sure what to do to help him. blind leading the blind, and all that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's less defensive than some people i've spoken to, although compared to kel, a brick wall would be less defensive.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i guess, not really knowing him, i approached him as if he was an intellectual equal, rather than as a troublemaker who needed to be calmed down.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, well, you know how much i love my hypotheticals.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: kel does not share my enthusiasm, and seemed to think i was trying to gain information in order to manipulate him or some such nonsense.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: arithnan, perhaps surprisingly, was more than happy to indulge me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes, but i never intend anything inappropriate with them!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i may be a calculating mastermind, but i'm not evil! just... ominous
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: besides, i've won him over, sort of, eventually. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not sure if it was with my winning personality, or with enabling lorsaen to, well. eliminate some of the difficulties involved with dating a half-frozen dead man
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that's possible
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i will pat myself on the back post-haste
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i appreciate it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if you keep saying that, it'll be so hard to keep up the illusion of not having feelings!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: shall we be on with it?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, and i'm the ominous one?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: farewell!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn joined channel.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's all about *drama* taalle
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sure, but sometimes it's nice to put a bit of flare on things 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: she could figure it out 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: delightful.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're complaining about smell, but have you ever smelled burnt flesh? *that's* disgusting 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think that's called "orcs trying to cook"
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: bleh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: fair enough
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i can't say i've ever eaten either of those things 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sort of missed the chance 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've had troll, at least, but orc isn't really my thing
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the way you phrased that makes it sound like you're eating people 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: pfft, no, i just thought it sounded funny 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's why i'm marrying lorsaen. he's the funny one 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, i've never *eaten* a troll.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but you have eaten an orc
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: much like kel, i made a poor attempt at wordplay, and it ended poorly
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hey!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: moebie said it first
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: D:
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: taalle, you don't seem the kind of woman who enjoys "play" of any sort. very.... no-nonsense
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you've caught me on an off day, mr. ....? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: who *are* you, anyway?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do you say that entire thing every time someone asks you for your name 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: why
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh. you're the soda man.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: is it true you used the titan minerals that gave your people sentience to make... soda?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: nobody really wants our names unless they want to yell at us, taalle
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: fascinating! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i mean, i am contractually obligated to express mild disapproval, because my best friend will never speak to me again if i don't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i am genuinely fascinated!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: gallons or tons, i would guess
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, there's plenty of titan minerals laying around other parts of azeroth!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm certain there's ways to rebuild, hm?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... depends
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: what do you have in mind? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: uh, no...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mr. sparkhammer, think outside the box! maybe kajamite is outside your reach, which is tragic, of course, but that's not the only thing you could purloin and use for imbibement
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, i'm not saying it couldn't have worked, i just didn't think of it. and he needs his heart, so i'd have to take someone else's, y'know
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: which is why i asked what you had in mind! it all depends on the circumstance, and who you're trying to..... woo, i guess 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i believe, as with most courting, it has to be unique to the person you're courting!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *makes a "cut it out gesture" at taalle*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm quite happy with how he is right now, taalle 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: condemning someone to undeath for no real reason isn't a very good way to make someone love you, i don't think 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: who, me? i did nothing. i'm innocent.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i only have one to begin with!
Nordaras has fueled a portal to Orgrimmar!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's ominous
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'd look out for alecea, though
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that may be the worst mistake you could make
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: most of them, presumably, don't involve angering a magister.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and an archmage! she holds both titles.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'll pour out some gasoline on your grave
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or whatever
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: of course
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: >:(
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he has a point
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... yeah, i guess
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, just that we're boring and don't know how to have fun 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: depends on how you define fun
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'll have you know i went out fishing just last week, and it was very fun 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: taalle is a stick in the mud. kel is just a boring old man.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not old!!!!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, but you manage to act like it, which is astounding.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't understand why enjoying something that's relaxing makes me old and boring 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, well, at least you *have* a hobby
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i have plenty of hobbies!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they grow up so fast, don't they?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn left channel.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: named for you, of course
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think if we found a purple witch hat you would do that anyway
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but then it would blend in with your hair, alecea
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you need contrast!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think that would be quite dashing!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooh, or perhaps a deep burgundy!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and then it would accentuate your hair
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they can be quite life changing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i believe miss rosemourn is ready to go
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea, may i put you in a marble?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nothing but the best for you, my friend!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this isn't normally the way i'd go for all of this, but i suppose we can take the *scenic* route
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: moebie?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: don't do that again when you're near me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i don't promise to not panic and throw you through a portal!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we're getting along so well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, alecea, you know i rarely resort to *yelling*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: um, just as a warning, though, there might be a few... more recent souls trapped in here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i'm about as alive as you are, plaguelord. and i had some business to deal with that required the forge, recently.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: namely, the trapping of a number of demon souls, ensuring that they weren't floating loose and wreaking havoc
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, good, everyone still has their limbs
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, not me, but that was before i got here
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, it certainly hasn't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it was quite lovely when it was just an enormous cursed glacier
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that, i would love to see
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: something i can do for you?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and here i thought talking to the frostlord was like talking to a brick wall
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you wound me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you'll have to get in line
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm afraid a number of people want to kill me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, be my guest
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: most of them are your coworkers
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, don't breathe too much of that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: still convinced she knows everything....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, we didn't try pointing ashbringer at them
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: as long as i can't see you!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i will have you know that i talked too much even before i died!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: vouch for me, alecea, i've always talked a lot
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's a perfectly servicable entrance into these chambers, i dont know why we insist on taking this convoluted route *every* time
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: now it's just a door, i think
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ugh. uther.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nobody loves the sound of their own voice more than a paladin...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you've managed to leave me flabbergasted
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this, dear friends, is why we don't charge off on ill-planned revenge missions alone
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i will put in a good word on your behalf
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, you've never sold anything off the books?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, maybe you should branch out.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: (we can take alecea and kill like, a singular person
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: plaguelord?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think you need a crash course in giving compliments
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okay
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea and i are plenty of fun! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i cannot speak to the fun levels of the plaguelord.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn also looks surprised.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you do?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *in Thalassian* is that because you don't like the goblin, and she scares him?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i suppose you *are* still friends with me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sorry, moebie!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: aaaand he's gone.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but most of what she thinks is apparently just stony silence or outright hostility
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, because that's interesting!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i understand plenty of things
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: just because you assume i don't, does not make it true
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we could go revisit the being this cat is named for, if you wanted something more productive to do
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, well, i'm not sure that's the best of places to be visiting right now--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: which is why i was suggesting to go bother the titans!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: goodness, moebie, any situation in which *i* play peacekeeper is an odd one indeed
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i won't comment on that statement
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: let's just go to the storm peaks. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: wave at my old outpost as you fly past
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: home? workshop? camp? i'm never sure what to call it. just where i had my front door. it used to be a lovely view, before all the construction
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes, but there was something about it when it was just the glacier...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've lived all sorts of places, but yes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i made my home here for several years both before and after my death
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i came here seeking beauty, danger, and knowledge, and i found all three in spades.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i did plenty of that, too!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: eurgh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: is that yours?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, the shambling thing that exploded.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: "beetlemuncher"?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: quite the name
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mr. sparkhammer, may i borrow your soul for a moment?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so if you fall, you'll be able to get back up again
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it won't hurt you, and i won't keep it! you can have the marble.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: like pulling out a splinter.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn hands Moebie a small marble.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ta-dah!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you're fine, your soul will go back to normal after a little bit
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's still gross to get off your boots
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: beautiful and laden with history!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: exactly!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: this is a good part of why i came to northrend in the first place
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: more full of rock people, though
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, they don't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: things get arguably more gross than simple rot with the old gods
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: huh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think if you sanitized taalle she would just cease to exist
Nordaras
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: since when do you have a *nephew*?
Nordaras a confused look. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no! neither you *or* arithnan mentioned it!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how the tables have turned, alecea...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would swear you hadn't. who *are* you talking about?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we talk about our personal lives plenty, i just didn't think he'd have *children*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: huh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, commander erileas' child?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, it's just a surprise.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: fascinating. i'll have to keep an eye out for the child.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: which of us?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: half night elf? fascinating.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn pats Alecea on the shoulder.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: taalle, the response is generally "i'm sorry for your loss"
Nordaras' hand.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okay
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can't say i speak goblin
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i suppose that's deserved
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm going to go look around for a bit. clear my mind, and all.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm back, did you all have fun?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well i know you didn't, moebie
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the frostlord is incredibly bothered by this particular person's existence
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he had a bit of a crisis about how a stone man could have a family lineage
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or, really, how he could have a family at all
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i assumed that they had the requisite *equipment* sculpted, but i think we got sidetracked before coming to any concrete conclusions
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: have you ever fucked a rock?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but have you known them biblically
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they walk and talk, they're certainly not just rocks
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i've done stranger
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: in the literal and euphemistic senses
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you've known me a long time
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i belive you've read some of my journals
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: moebie, i have traveled the world and fucked more people than you have probably ever met.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if that's nerd shit, then so be it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn coughs.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: anyway.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i find the history of the trolls slightly less compelling than the titans, but still! the history in these frozen streets....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the lives that must have once been lived here are humbling to think about
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's generally what an ancient street is
Nordaras has fueled a portal to Orgrimmar!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Crescent Wand
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do we wanna get a gang together and run black temple?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have to switch to erileas for that but yknow
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alexz is afk but im gonna hop over and just tell her over boice
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hello!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: once more we find ourselves in scenic pandaria
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you said you wanted to see me, though?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not sure i buy it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but, how have you been?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nothing new and exciting, at all?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, i suppose
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: arithnan, what's going on with you? you're very reserved today.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't think anything i have done recently is any way on par with you actually speaking with thalanor!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but that's a start!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooh, brunch! i love brunch.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: of course!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or, i used to. i don't need to eat any more, so i don't do it much. but, conceptually? of course!
Nordaras the Fearless'.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can, if i really feel like it, although most things that aren't raw flesh give me horrible indigestion.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: most of the bits of my body still work more or less, but many of them work rather poorly.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm, yes?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i will have you know that *that* is perfectly functional
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would have been considerably more cross with arthas if it hadn't been
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, most people don't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i am always happy to clear up any misconceptions
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i understand completely, arithnan.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and, both as a bit of fun trivia, and to perhaps clarify what i've been up to, since i never answered your question, it turns out that you can absolutely have sex with a ghost, if they focus very hard
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that he is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am a man of many talents, dear arithnan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: one of which is, apparently, getting fucked by ghosts
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that farondis fellow was doing rather well for himself
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or any of his people, really. although, i suppose night elves are less excitingly different for you, being an illidari, and all that?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not dead ones, obviously, but still
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i suppose that's fair
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you have more experience with the demonic side of things to compensate for lack of undead, though
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can't claim to have ever wanted to have sex with charnagma
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not exactly... attractive in any capacity
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he claims that, for one of his kind, he's highly desirable, but i have no way to verify that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there really are, aren't there. and they're all more undressed than you are!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't know, although i will admit to being incredibly curious, just because it doesn't make sense
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if you could pick any variety of demon to sleep with-- just one, pretending for a moment that you haven't already been with multiple, which i assume to be the truth
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what "species" is you favorite?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's also very distracting
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there are technological marvels on argus, but, apparently, a massive underwear shortage
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that *is* a lot of hands to be doing things with
Nordaras-ArgentDawn frowns and seems to be counting something.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't think there's enough places for hands to be to justify that many! four, maybe. six is probably excessive
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i don't trust them not to do whatever it is succubi and incubi do with souls
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mine is messed up enough, thank you very much
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have a bit of a personal distaste for dreadlords, but i can see the appeal
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you all seem to be perfectly happy just having fun with each other
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do you all do that metamorphosis thing? i would love to... study that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i actually do want to study it, mind you, but my interest is not *entirely* scientific
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, goodness
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, research is no good if your sample size is one person, as interesting and handsome as he may be
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, but it's at least partially scientific
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: which primarily means that i take lots of notes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: in general? yes. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but you must understand that anything non-hostile that draws power from the fel is both rare and fascinating
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do wish i'd had the chance to, ah, inspect you before the transformation, for comparison purposes, although before and after the metamorphosis is also worth investigating
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm sure you were!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: did you notice any physical changes, other than the obvious?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was about to ask you to clarify, thank you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you do, and i'm very appreciative.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you do have those fascinating little... cuts
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that sounds awful!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes, they're obvious, but still fascinating
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do they hurt? or-- they look like they might *leak*?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn peers at Arithnan.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that sounds like hell.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: literal, actual hell.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i doubt you need an excuse to lay around naked, but i take your meaning
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: casual nudity was not much of a thing amongst the scourge, although abject misery certainly was
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what *does* come out of them when they do leak?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: unfortunately, i missed that excursion
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how fascinating!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that seems like it would hurt you, wouldn't it?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn gently pokes Arithnan in the ribs.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: gah, that's disgusting
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not you, you're just as lovely up close
Nordaras-ArgentDawn wipes his fel-coated fingers against the edge of a glass vial he pulled from somewhere in his robes. How much shit is he carrying around?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: believe me, this is as good as my face gets
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's worse without the filling
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, yes, well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if it makes you feel any better, part of my face is more or less hanging open
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you could theoretically get your revenge, although right now there's a bit of metal in your way
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, a bit of my face got scratched off when i was dying, and it's, well--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn does some weird shit with his hand and disables his prosthetic cheek, sticking his finger through the now-open skin to demonstrate.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't know how well you can see, but, my teeth are now fully visible
Nordaras-ArgentDawn turns his head, showing off his fucked up face, silently offering Arithnan a chance at really dumb revenge.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, but it hurt you, and it really won't hurt me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, do you not want to put your fingers in my mouth? i didn't expect you to be so reluctant
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm very difficult to make uncomfortable
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wouldn't have offered if i didn't want you to, arithnan, but i'm not going to force it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but, you know, since you can't really see what's going on...
Nordaras' hair out of the way before sticking his fingers through the hole in his face.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you leaving that in there?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn raises his eyebrows.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: more or less
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i tried drinking wine without it, once, just to see if i could, and i definitely could not
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i managed to ruin my shirt in the process
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: obviously, my teeth get in the way, so i would probably just end up with things in my gums 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, well, i was bored
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: generally i found things to do, but, well, we all have to do dumb shit now and again, don't we?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, you certainly don't have a monopoly on making bizarre choices.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: nor do have a monopoly on day drinking or sleeping with random people, i might add
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i know, i know, i'm horrible!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: truly, what could i ever do for breaking your heart and crushing your dreams like this
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do tell
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not a mind reader, i'm just a note taker
Nordaras-ArgentDawn feigns innocence.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do tell me what you intend?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that certainly sounds like a plan to me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: of course, i'll need to find a wall, somewhere
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: maybe just make use of that inn just down the hill
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i need a solid wall or other flat surface to set my home into
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think we would get immediately booted from that inn
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's walls in my home, too, where we won't upset any poor unsuspecting pandaren
Nordaras-ArgentDawn carefully traces out a rectangle on the wall. A solid wooden door appears as he finishes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: come along, then?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, do stop talking, or i'll have to do something about it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i accept this challenge
Nordaras-ArgentDawn opens the door and jerks his head towards the interior.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: shall we?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and they're natives!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wish they weren't so hostile
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the things we could learn from them....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the trolls were everywhere in azeroth, and then just stayed put when it split
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i believe
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: either that or they have very good boats
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: bye
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's fine, i'll figure it out
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh the spirit flayers knock you off
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they sure do
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i thought maybe that was a safe zone bc it's blue
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: which is a very dumb line of thought
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, and i kept landing on them
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: rip
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, that explains what we were saying about the zandalar
Nordaras and stamps his tail!
Nordaras and stamps his tail!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: isn't this invigorating!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you can have an awful lot of fun with trolls, but this isn't generally how i prefer it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they do all kinds of interesting things with their regeneration abilities
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, have you ever seen a lizard regrow a limb?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or a lizard with two tails from having one removed and growing it back a little wrong?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mmm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: point being, they work like that on all appendages
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: possible in more than just theory, dear arithnan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and very fun
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it doesn't sound pleasant, does it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: is it just me, or are the mogu kind of hot?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you can't tell me you aren't at least interested
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: technically, all of the life on azeroth was once rocks
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but they're rocks carved to look like muscular men who could easily pick you up with one hand
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: chafing is for people who aren't talented alchemists
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: absolutely
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it's not like i need to worry about dying, just making sure that there's enough lubrication, which is frankly rudimentary to accomplish
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: internal organ damage is no joke!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i wouldn't have considered it if i could still die
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what, and fucking a 12 foot plus demonic you, or a man who is entirely frozen, is somehow better?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: not if they're polished!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, don't do that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and you are aware that polished, non-toxic stone is often used for... purposes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, but how else will i find out?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: determination
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i will remind you that i managed to make things work with your alternate form
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: creativity and innovation
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i don't know! but that's why i need to find out
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: where did you go?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and that's why i like you so much, such a sense of adventure!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do not want to fuck this thing
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's calling us playthings!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i didn't consent to whatever he was trying to do there
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i wonder what's in those vats....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, but what are the properties of the goo?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would prefer not to
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooooooh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't know what it is but i'm about to find out
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's dripping
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it probably is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: OH
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: huh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ugh more spiders
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: how.... lovely
Nordaras is affected by Lightning Storm !
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well
Nordaras is affected by Lightning Storm !
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you're starting to sound like me!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but you're absolutely right
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: stunning, but... dark
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it does, doesn't it?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooh, this too!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: they come in *female*?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, why have sexual dimorphism if they aren't capable of sex?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ooooh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do love a good staircase
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: a brilliant madman
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thats the point, i think
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: look at this...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that orb.... the stonework.....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's so stunning
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: the gold on the floors... the carving....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's raised, touch it!
Kelahnias: no, not really 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the decorations are nice, at least 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but there's.. no snow, which i feel sort of defeats the purpose 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i can stand uncomfortably close to you if you'd like to fix that, dear 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do i look like a mage to you?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: she'd have much more success, probably
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: still like... i think the scale's a bit large, and it'd just melt again
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: don't make that face at me
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well maybe they shouldn't have settled in a desert! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... feel like that's a lot of work
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it might be easier just to teleport someone to northrend if they wanted it that badly
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: look, he made it snow!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: what... is that a sweater
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: with your normal armor on top?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: at least take off the shoulder pads!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel leans over and plants a kiss on Lorsaen's cheek.*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Much better.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: somehow, you've gotten even shorter
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: have i ever told you i detest beards?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's very impressive
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i did... attempt to get you a gift, if there's a moment you'd like to have it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: don't choke, dear 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's-- that's not the point
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: besides, i've already got everything i need, thank you very much 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: besides, there's a good chance you won't even like it, so, 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .......... did you want legos
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .......... shit 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... i thought it kind of looked like something you would wear, with the red and the little stripes that look sort of like knives..
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, you don't have to say that if you don't mean it.. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and don't feel like you have to wear it, or anything, just, you know, i thought you might like to have options!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... by all means, don't argue with taalle 
Kelahnias glares angrily at Orgrimmar Grunt.
Kelahnias flexes at you.  Oooooh so strong!
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias blushes at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... really?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: who's to say if you were shoehorned into that! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen...
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if i have to scrape you off of the pavement to put you back together i'm going to be very cross
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias looks at you and covers his face with his palm.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: what did i JUST say
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hey!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... lorsaen!!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ..... guess i'll have to find someone else to spend winter veil with. my fiance has both betrayed and left me.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: covering his poor fiance with snow, as if i needed more of that
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ..... get back here so i can shove snow in your face!
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn shakes his fist in Lorsaen's general direction.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn pushes some excess snow from his armor into Lorsaen's face. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hello, dear
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: are you quite finished?
Kelahnias: ... i'll catch you!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: taffy!
Kelahnias gently pats Taffy.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do you think we could get her a little hat to wear that wouldn't phase through her?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if you sew it, i can figure out... something, probably
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hmm, maybe
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you are... so festive
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i could list plenty of things that you are in addition to festive, but right now your festivity is the most obvious
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i didn't mean it as a bad thing--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm very glad you're excited. it's.. so nice to see. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, you'll have to eat cake in my honor 
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, we need to find our way back to orgrimmar, yes?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you... did say you wanted snow
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .. because apparently being cold nearly every day of the year just isn't enough for you..
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .. is it really?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ...... how?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean.. yeah
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... if you say so.. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: are you.. okay
Kelahnias pokes you.  Hey!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: is that a common urge for you
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: because it wouldn't surprise me 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: fascinating 
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: really, it's a wonder you don't sing more often 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: take care of him
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he... doesn't know how to face forwards
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he's trying, but tragically his creator was a bit of a dumbass
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... well
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: boooo
Kelahnias gently pats you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's quite dashing
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel swipes Lorsaen's hat and places it on his own hat.*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: HEAD*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .. my hat now
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: how rude!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's no way to get your hat back
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ....
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe so
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no!! i want a hat!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i never wear hats.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: a WHAT
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'LL BE RIGHT BACK CALM DOWN
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: (i have,,,, one ebonweave but there's no imbued frostweave on the auction house(
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: somehow you got even smaller
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, moebie's even smaller than you are
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ....... i.. don't like that statement
Kelahnias lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen, do i need to find a healer or a.. magic dispeller for you. is this a cry for help. are you trapped in snowman form.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think that might melt him
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: please don't melt my fiance i need him 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he has a wedding to show up for in a few weeks he can't be a puddle 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hey taalle
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's a sensitive subject don't bring it up
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: don't MELT HIM
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... finally?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... that's for earlier
Kelahnias blows you a kiss.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're BUBBLING
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're going to choke to death on that candy cane and i'm going to be powerless to stop it
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think moebie's a man who understands alcohol
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... hm
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no one on this planet could ever control that mortal, taalle
Kelahnias looks at you and covers his face with his palm.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: listen.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we're both wearing pants. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: there are pants underneath the greaves00
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: --*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: taalle please do not kill and/or maim my fiance
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: PLEASE DO NOT
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: taalle, think of it this way
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if you kill him, you'll have to deal with him on acherus, too
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn left channel.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it's very important to conserve one's energy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or something
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, well, he's more of lap-cat than a mouser
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i'm quite glad you do
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: sooo, alecea, you know how you've told me to keep you posted if i do anything particularly outlandish?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and to avoid doing those sorts of things in general?
Nordaras suspiciously.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i... may have... done something.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you've seen the highlord's new, ah, situation? with regards to arms?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes, except that i happened to be in the vicinity after she subdued her attacker
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: an eradar assassin-- her former husband, as a matter of fact
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: for the second time in my life, i used the ritual to bind a demon and he's, ah, currently living in my basement.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i asked her first!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he may have fallen, but he *was* her husband once. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm not doing this for my own gain, i'm doing this because i believe he might be able to be freed from the legion's control
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: alecea, i don't know how closely you watched the conversation that prophet velen had with kil'jaeden, at the end there?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: because i made sure to listen in and-- alecea, even *kil'jaeden*, of all people, seemed remorseful at the end. he said he hoped that we would succeed. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: if he could come to the point of saying that, what could be done with someone like nihhan?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he's as likely to do that as charnagma is, alecea.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: charnagma also isn't--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn exhales sharply.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have no idea what charnagma was before he was-- this.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn gestures vaguely to the Voidwalker.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't even know if voidwalkers *were* anything else
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i know for a fact that thousands of years ago, nihhan was the kind of man that the highlord would marry. he's trying to fight it, i can tell.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: here's why i don't try to ask charnagma anything:
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: charnagma, what do you think of azeroth?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Charnagma says: WHEN I AM FREE I WILL BURN YOU TO CINDERS AND USE YOUR SKULL FOR DECORATIONS. I WILL DO IT QUICKLY. THIS IS THE MERCY YOU DESERVE FOR BEING A MEDIOCRE MASTER.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank you. nihhan probably needs it more than me, though.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: mediocre is a compliment, as far as he goes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Charnagma says: THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE ARRANGED. I WILL NEED SOMETHING FROM WHICH TO DRINK YOUR EXTENSIVE WINE STORES.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, let it be said now that i would prefer to be a chalice.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Charnagma says: THIS IS ACCEPTABLE.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Charnagma says: I DON'T EVEN LIKE WINE. BUT BLOOD GIVES ME INDIGESTION.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Charnagma says: AND WHAT ELSE IS A DEMON SUPPOSED TO DRINK.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Charnagma says: THE ONE WITH THE RED HAIR AND THE CRACKED SKIN? I KNOW HIM. JUST RECENTLY HE AND THIS ONE--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: charnagma.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's-- that's enough. of that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn adjusts his collar.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn glares at Charnagma.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: scientific research. on, you know, how the demon hunters, er,
Nordaras-ArgentDawn gestures vaguely.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i did.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have been told that i need to-- to prepare myself to... move on. arithnan has been blatantly eyeing me since we met, and i thought, you know
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: in my defense, there was some amount of genuine academic curiosity involved! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, alecea, it was fine!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i had told him earlier that he was welcome to flirt but that nothing would come of it and he was willing to respect that without protest
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i-- *we* ran into... one of the other fragments of arthas' soul.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it-- it seems to have made him feel much more himself, but it-- it made him fade. i have a strong hunch as to where the last fragment is, and when we find it... he's gone for good.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we had a talk. he pointed out that even if we'd met under considerably better circumstances, i still would have spent hundreds of years without him.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, it's-- i'm more okay with it now. to have the chance to say goodbye at all, to get closure, anything. it's... not the best case scenario for *me*, but--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think he deserves to actually rest.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: he wants to see the fight against the legion through to the end, and then it'll be... time to say goodbye.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't think this will be easy, or fast, to deal with, but, well, that's why i'm beginning now.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: funny, it's the first time a relationship has ever ended when it wasn't on my terms
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i would too.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but, well, we carry on.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ..?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn hugs her back.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: thank you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but-- goodness, where are my manners-- how is everything with you?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's certainly the place to be, these days.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, if you were a baker, you wouldn't be able to defend yourself quite as well!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: we do seem to be fighting... gods
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, either we'll figure it out or we... won't
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: er, well, i can't speak to that
Nordaras-ArgentDawn stares at Alecea like she's grown a third arm.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: pardon?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: erm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: arithnan is mostly an attractive elf, you can't fault me for that!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i am trying to *help* nihhan
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i never
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hold still 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... wait
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen thinks the postman is a demon 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that or just... a combined effort between alecea de'kay and nordaras
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: don't, the longer you think about it the more concerning it is 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: is the meeting stone... outside
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... feel like he might make a bit of an effort to avoid paladins
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sort.. of?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: although i think he gifts the highlord wine so?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't know. he's a bit odd.
Kelahnias nods at Moebie.
Kelahnias with a hearty hello!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: is that... a different fish from earlier?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you... generally aren't supposed to poke fish, no
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i freeze most things 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: please, don't
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you... know each other??
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh she... has no pants on 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: OOP
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn inspects Stephen curiously. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: is he comfortable in there?
Kelahnias creates: Refreshing Pineapple Punchx6.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm... not certain that a lawsuit is their biggest concern?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i didn't know that parrots were... carnivorous? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, dear
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i have more of that... juice, if you want it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, maybe that would make it better
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and please don't call me that
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i already offered to just *give* it to you--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... taffy tried to eat one of those, once, and it fell right through her 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do you think the darkmoon faire would produce spectral corndogs if i asked? 
Kelahnias rolls his eyes.
Kelahnias looks at you and covers his face with his palm.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: -- really, i can leave if you're busy scheduling dates, or.. something 
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias sighs at Moebie.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i believe most people are bad influences when compared with paladins 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you're doing fine, really 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn left channel.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: so, how have you been the past few days? rather exciting, isn't it, to be done with all that?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i scarcely know what to do with myself any more, without some huge fight looming
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, yes, i do suppose so
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: still, you aren't being pulled away constantly to fight, yes?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, elivan, um.... please do get up
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: are you?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, you gave me quite the fright.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, don't go telling everyone, i do have appearances to keep up, after all, but yes, i must say it's true
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i'm certain that's not true. i listen to you! and i should very well hope that the bloodlord does, as well, or else i shall be having very stern words with him.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: my friend, whatever happened to you?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do remember you prodding me about my refusal to speak straight to you, and i will return the favor if needed
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: then tell me what's on your mind!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i can't vouch for anyone else, but... perhaps the stress is just getting to everyone? there's plenty of medical conditions that cause auditory hallucinations, many of which can be caused or exacerbated by stress, or by physical traumas of some sort
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and we've all had plenty of those the past few days.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...but, well, you did sort of turn even more voidy on antorus, and i wonder if you, too, need some time to recover
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, it was a very stressful situation! we all pulled out the big guns, no shame in that, i showed up with an eredar, but you aren't immune to needing to rest after such a strenuous fight!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have a few things i need to... deal with, myself, but i'm holding off for a week or so, in order to recover. there's no shame in that! the stress gets to everyone!
Nordaras and stamps his tail!
Nordaras and stamps his tail!
Nordaras and stamps his tail!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i'm certain you do! but you deserve some time off after all the hard work you do, don't you think?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, well, that's valid, i suppose?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn clears his throat. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose i did promise that, didn't i.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, then, here is the truth. you are scaring me, elivan. you are angrier than i have ever seen you, even when you were, ah, putting in me in my place, as it were.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: telling me off.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you did *something* on antorus and nearly collapsed because of it. and your first thought when people keep thinking you're saying odd things is not that you might be doing it, but that everyone else is crazy.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i know i am in no position to tell anyone off due to their dabblings, and i fear i sound exactly like alecea when i say this, but i'm worried about you, elivan.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's a difference between a newfound confidence after a decisive victory and whatever this is
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't know what to think, elivan. either something went wrong on antorus and caused you to do *that*, or nothing went wrong and you did it on purpose. either way... 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn makes a vague gesture and opens and closes his mouth wordlessly.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you've been a very good friend to me, elivan, better than i deserve. and i'm worried about what i see.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, i don't think that you're crazy. i think that you're...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's just as i said. i'm worried about you. for you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think that you're in danger.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there's a difference between being *in* danger and causing the danger yourself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i think sometimes it can, if not appropriately handled. like how a common cold can easily become a severe infection if untreated?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's why i asked you to rest. magic is notorious for being impacted by the wielder's state of mind. maybe this would all clear up if you simply gave yourself some downtime. take the deathlord somewhere nice for a few weeks, or something.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, that isn't what i meant. i believe you had some very stern words for me when i played this game of twisting words to be down on myself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, well. wonderful!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, doesn't it? i've gathered he's very fond of parts of pandaria, and i'm certain the dragon would also enjoy it!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: elivan, my friend, nobody should be needing any of our services for some time yet. the fallen titan is imprisoned, the legion retreating. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, cho! don't you think he'd be happy to return to his homeland, even if just for a short while?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: perhaps the best application of your considerable talents at the moment would be to ensure the bloodlord is kept as healthy as he can be, and be brought somewhere that he would be at peace?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it will be fine, elivan, i'm certain. but, if that is truly your worry, i am certain there is some way that myself and the archmages de'kay and flameleaf could rig up an emergency teleportation something or other, so that you could return if needed.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am certain it could be arranged. we're very talented people, after all.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i did! i am almost more proud of saving an eredar, but the titan part is very cool as well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i can't say i recall saying that exactly, but... huh.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no, not that i recall, although i... suppose i may have
Nordaras-ArgentDawn gives a worried glance to seemingly empty air.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: saying goodbye has certainly been on my mind, of late, but i don't suppose i've mentioned it that often.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's been several years since i was last *part* of something, and i fear it may have ruined me. once, i was perfectly content to do my own thing, but i fear i've gotten a taste for teamwork.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: with the legion defeated, there's no reason for the forces of legionfall to continue to exist. i will continue on, as i ever do, but still, it saddens me to part from so many allies.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: to part from having a purpose.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i suppose nihhan is an ongoing project, however.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, i do suppose so, although i fear that few things would bring *all* of us together without being, in some way or another, rather terrible
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, i suppose so
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, if you already know everything that's on my mind, why don't you just look a little harder and find out for yourself?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: there is absolutely no way you could know all these things i haven't said. i have been fairly open with you, elivan, because you're my friend, but i do not appreciate having the privacy of my own thoughts violated in this way. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: whatever it is that's happening.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, now that's on cooldown

Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: OH NO
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's gonna throw me out to a graveyard.... but im saved to the instance so i sure do hope it works out
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: pls...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ohhh thank fuck
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it worked
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: or looong rest
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: wooooah
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: JESTER
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i LOVE HER
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: SHE'S SO GOOD 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: "DONT COME IN I'M NAKED"
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i miss you alreaaadyyyy
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: THE DICE JAIL CUP
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: fjord...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i love him so much
Kelahnias greets you with a hearty hello!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: frostlord! you have absolutely no idea how happy i am to see you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm... happy to see you, too? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... why are you happy to see me??
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i have been having an incredibly weird and distressing day and your no-nonsense, semi-scowling face is an absolute delight.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: uhm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: glad to be of service?
Kelahnias receives item: Breastplate of the All-Consuming Maw.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ah, yes, well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i do have some business i wanted to broach with you, on a much less cheerful note.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: go ahead. i'm not... used to cheerful, it's weird.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i am less cheerful and more relieved than anything, i promise you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if you, uh, say so
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: by all means, continue
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: with the legion's defeat, the time has come to reuinite arthas with the final piece of his soul, hopefully allowing him to move on once and for all. it is not something that i look forward to, but it must be done.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i intend to go to northrend, to the chapel where his shattered heart lies. within the week.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i fear if i dilly dally too long i may never go at all
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... see
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i thought i would notify you, so that you would not be concerned if this staff suddenly becomes inert
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and why does that involve me, exactly? i.. believe i gave you that spirit to do with it what you would, with the exception of anything... ridiculous. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, i appreciate you seeking to put my mind at ease, then 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i simply wanted to make sure you knew i hadn't done anything untoward, or tried to somehow squirrel him away.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and i wasn't sure if you would want to supervise or something along those lines
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, i certainly can, if you'd like 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy tugs urgently on Kel's hand.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... what is it, dear? 
Kelahnias kneels before Taffy.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: I don't think that was the Prince in that heart. It was my friend.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn raises an eyebrow, but stays silent.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: your... friend? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: Matthias? The little boy? You remember him, right?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn pauses for a moment, trying to remember. Of course he remembers, it would be silly not to. Pfft. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: The... young ghost that we met in the pit, in Icecrown? Is that who you mean? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: Yeah, of course! He was really nice. We had a snowball fight!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn raises an eyebrow.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: a... snowball fight? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: You and Papa did a lot of walking around and fighting stuff, and he was sorta hanging around. I was bored! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn looks very offended.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we always walk around and fight stuff! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn shakes his head. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: Yeah, but there aren't always other little kid ghosts!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... suppose you've got a point 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: I think Mister Nordaras is wrong, but if he isn't... My friend would be going away forever, wouldn't he? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn nods sadly.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i fear so, young lady.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy frowns.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm.. sorry, dear. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: I don't wanna never see my friend again!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: taffy, that's... usually what happens when people die, you know 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn gives Nordaras a look that says 'this is your fault, help me out here.'
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: But-- But-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn shrugs, looking at Kel like "I'm garbage with children what do you want"
Nordaras-ArgentDawn clears his throat.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i-- 
Kelahnias sighs at Taffy.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: young lady, i am certain that he would be happy to see you again.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: perhaps your dear guardian here would be willing to escort you, as i am certain he would be quite happy to see me proven wrong.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn gives Nordaras a new, completely different look, that says 'that's NOT what I meant.' 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: and if i am not wrong, then at least you would be able to say goodbye to your friend. i understand that closure is important.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... is that what you want, tabitha? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn shrugs. You asked him for help, you got it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy looks distraught for a moment, staring at the ground. She nods.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: I... I think so. I don't wanna say goodbye, but I don't wanna never see Matthias again either.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm... i'm sorry, dear. it's the best i can do. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: I wanna go.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: Please?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, you can go. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy smiles.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, i suppose this will be a grand adventure for all of us!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: a grand adventure indeed
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: taffy, do you trust me? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy tilts her head, confused.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: Um... yes?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i.. wish that you could play with your friend forever, but please, trust me when i say that it will be better to let your friend rest, even if it means having to say goodbye
Nordaras-ArgentDawn nods at her.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: I guess so.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... thank you 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn kneels down and presses a kiss to where Taffy's forehead should be.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy giggles.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn grins at her.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: let's keep going, then? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yes, let's. i'll let you know when i know when we'll be leaving.
Kelahnias receives item: Pauldrons of the All-Consuming Maw.
Kelahnias receives item: Helmet of the All-Consuming Maw.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: we're huge!
Kelahnias has died.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hmm
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i fell off
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not sure how we were supposed to not do that
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: moving against it didn't help!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: maybe get wedged against a pillar?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: probably
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: everyone i know can run faster than me :/
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i set my feet on fire to do it
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: it's not a great idea
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and yet, you do it anyways
Kelahnias has died.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh hey
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it doesn't say how to counter it 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: maybe stay right in the center and use yr speed boost?
Kelahnias has died.
Kelahnias creates: Healthstone.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was reloading so idk if u said anything
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: come stand in middle
Kelahnias has died.
Kelahnias has died.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: (i might can survive if i equip this Man'ari Training Amulet
Kelahnias has died.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: hm yeah this might not be happening
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i could bring... someone else??
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think All of my characters have access to this stupid island at this point hdskjf
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: is anyone gonna be better off than kel?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Everyone has more movement capabilities than kel
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: because you just go straight down so idk if arithnan would be like, better off
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's what i was thinking 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but like, he's got the dashes
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and he Runs faster than kel does by a Lot
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: but i also don't know if it's like, being out of bounds or the fall damage
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: true....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or we could just try later
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i wanna,,,, give it a shot
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: one more try
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: okey dokey
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just to see if i can Fuckign Survive for once
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn left channel.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: INITIATIVE
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ready?
Nordaras, Storm's End'.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: yeah
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i love that they just Don't give a warning for what it'll be
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: do we wanna take on shot at it and see how bad it is?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i understand
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: im gonna go poke my head in and see what's down there just for funsies
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ohhhh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's baaaaad
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ATTEMPTS REMAINING 30
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i dont think this is good
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: what is IN there
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: its fine he doesn't have That much health

Kelahnias-ArgentDawn left channel.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn takes One look at Thelladus and just kind of sighs a little.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... hi
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... no, but you're here. and you're a paladin. and you're.. well, you? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you really have no idea how uninterested i am in whatever moebie brings out in you 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: uh, no offense
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... think i follow? but i mean, that's alright. i don't need an.. a-team paladin to kill some scarlet crusaders. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: really, i'd be a garbage paladin too, so it's fine
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i've seen plenty of undead that can use the Light, thank you very much. though i have no idea how they do it. and i'm.... decidedly not one of them. by a lot. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... have no idea. it physically hurts me to watch. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, it kind of hurts to watch normal paladins as it is, but that's for different reasons.
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's not at all what i meant-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: really, it has nothing to do with you specifically. i'm sure you're fine. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i cannot believe the rarest mount in this fuckign game is a dick rocket
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... sure! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mostly just meant the whole.. holy light thing. it tends to burn a bit, you know. but like, in a manageable way. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, nothing about being a death knight is really ideal, but-- 
Kelahnias shrugs.  Who knows?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... you don't know many death knights, do you? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... i'm familiar, yes
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, that's... probably for the best. the plaguelands aren't exactly the msot friendly of places.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: they really do!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... was that a pressing concern for you? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... guess? i didn't really notice, what with all the demons.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: still, clearly you can't be that bad of a paladin if you were on argus and, uh, you know. survived.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, clearly you must have brought some amount of skill the the equation, then 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, yes, but i don't-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: did you say 'aw dunk'
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: is that a common phrase in the argent crusade???
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ah.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's.. fine
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yep. yep i'm.. good. great. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just maybe try... not to do that again, if you can help it 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: they sure did
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, maybe he should have been nicer to his dogs.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: your dogs won't eat you if you're *nice* to them
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i would say that's probably a safe bet. i can't imagine a fish managing to eat you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: unless you're just hanging out in the ocean, or something
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: there are bigger fish there.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that like to eat people.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i am a little curious where you got your fish?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... specific.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just, like, in a river, or..??
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you keep talking like you haven't been anywhere because you're not a skilled paladin, but you've been plenty of places! and lived! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he is very cute, and i can't imagine he'd be very filling.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so you... said you work at those little towers scattered through the plaguelands? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: when you're not, you know, slaying demons on an entirely different planet--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: really grubs.. should not be that large
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, don't take out your dislike on bananas! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: it's not their fault..
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... guess. i'd never thought about it like that. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sorry, did you say you liked cheese? i have some but, you know, i won't eat it, so..
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, no use in letting it go to waste
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: they did you dirty....
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm not sure how lorsaen feels about cheese... probably better that you have it, honestly
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh, anyways, i'd meant to ask how long you worked at those towers
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: like... battle for light's hope a while or..?
Kelahnias laughs.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah, that'll happen
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: still that's... a very long time to spend in the plaguelands. i'm so sorry.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: does the argent crusade give you like... vacation days? or like, a pension in event of accidental undeath?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i feel like they should have that.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i will say, you are very much unlike any other paladins i've met. if only because you.. haven't tried to yell at me for anything, yet.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: a... *Kel can't even keep a straight face. He's fuckign snickering, which looks absolutely ridiculous on a death knight* a.. tongue.. lashing? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah? is it?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you are, officially, my favorite paladin. of the ones that are still alive, anyways.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i don't think anyone else has called me kind as much as you have
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i... think it's still physically in the right place? it's just not.. doing much. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: though i'm still not sure 'metaphorically' can apply either, but please, feel free to continue showering me with compliments
Kelahnias laughs.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, i don't try to be confusing. i think i mostly specialize in just being confused. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and i'm glad *somebody* appreciates the effort i put into my hair-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen thinks the amount of hair product i have to use is ridiculous. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, you could get rid of the bangs?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: or just, like, grow them out and tuck them behind your ears..
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i mean, if you like them, keep them!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but, i mean, i wouldn't be worried about a.. large forehead, or whatever. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sorry, but really, i'm just kind of curious and like... are you and moebie like.. a.. thing?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... fascinating 
Kelahnias waves goodbye to you.  Farewell!
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] This seems a better place to chat. Now, this may be insensitive, but you seem rather, well, purple. For not being night elves, I mean.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] What gives?
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Void powers? How is that going for you? Those normally cause, you know, insanity?
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Hm. I have the oddest feeling of deja vu, right now. A dear friend of mine recently protested the same thing about his own void condition. Of course, this was in between bouts of mind-reading and disconcerting muttering.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Hm. Yes. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] So, the Alliance is recruiting those banished for dabbling too deeply in the void. Fascinating. I hold no love for the Horde myself, of course. Your secret is safe with me.
Nordaras Heartbinder, at your disposal.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I'm afraid you have one over on me now, as I don't know your names at all!
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Or that of your very large and very, very, very dangerous Worgen friend back there.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] It's a pleasure to meet you, Sazhe Dreamshadow. And, Dedwall, too, of course.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] A very respectable name.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I fear my Common is a bit rusty, Dedwall. I didn't catch a word of that.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh. My Orcish is worse than my Common, actually.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I would very much like to pick that plant he's standing on, though.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] So, what brings *you* lot to Duskwood on this lovely evening?
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] There's nothing down the road that you should go looking into. Karazhan is fascinating, and beautiful, but it is also deadly. Even in death, Medivh guards his tower jealously.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Valineth Shadebloom. It's a pleasure to meet you.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I see you practice more than one form of oft-banned magic, Val.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] A very odd looking dog.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] There would be more, but my, ah, friend, he wanted to run some errands today.
ordaras-ArgentDawn | Charnagma says: THIS FOREST SUCKS.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Quite forwards, aren't you? I suppose it depends on which of my demonically-inclined friends you're inquiring about.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Er, no. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Not... at the moment. Exactly.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] If you must know, I've had quite a loss recently, and I'm still dealing with that.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh, no, it's no problem at all. I do some of my best dealing of things with strangers. After all, it's unlikely we will ever cross paths again. I am nothing to you, just as you are nothing to me. Whatever we say to each other is inconsequential.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] You have a very upbeat disposition, and are more inclined to trust me than most I've met. Not that it's unappreciated, but, I do wonder what it is that makes you so willing to trust me?
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh, don't underestimate me.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] That's a common sentiment, but one I fear I don't share. I left home several centuries ago, and never felt any urge to return. But there's many who agree with you, for various reasons.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I fought on Argus, my new friends. I may be outnumbered, but I don't know that I'm especially *outmatched*.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Silvermoon is lovely. My home, technically, was lovely. My family is made up entirely of horrible, horrible people. I do not regret leaving them behind.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] No. I haven't spoken to any of them in some 15-odd years.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I'm certain they think I died, which is not technically incorrect.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh, I desperately hope you didn't have any of my sisters inflicted on you.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Which one was it.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Beth wouldn't have left home for anything, and--
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh, I am, from the bottom of my heart, very sorry for what you've had to endure.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Eili takes very thoroughly after our mother.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Well, she's more than 600 years my elder, for one.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] For another, I left before mother and father got their poisonous ways into my head. And I had a friend who was willing to keep me in line.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] She is! I don't know what I would do if she wasn't. The thought alone is really too much to bear.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Well, you seem to be doing better now. And I would be very, very appreciative if you didn't mention meeting me to Eiliniya. I have rather enjoyed the past four-odd years of my family thinking I'm dead.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] That does sound like her. She's never realized that our parents' expectations were a cage. She's bought it, hook line and sinker, that those bars were there to keep her safe and away from all the "unworthies".
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Maybe now that the cage has been smashed, she'll figure it out. Or she'll keep trying to climb back inside. I don't much care either way.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I will tell you this much, though. One of the very few things my sister and I have in common is the pride we take in our hair. It's odd, I know, but it's true. If you really want to get her goat, go for that. But you didn't hear it from me.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Hah. King Anduin Wrynn would have to drag her onto the battlefield himself, and she'd complain the whole way.
Nordaras throws his hand across his forehead and feigns swooning*
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I doubt anyone could, frankly. We tend to be high-strung people.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] You know, I'm not really used to it either.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Yes, Val, you've been very quiet. What's your tale of woe? Do share with the rest of us.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Very polite of you.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh! Well, I suppose that's fair. The peacock is lovely.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Val, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I don't think that's a female peacock.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] If only because the females are called "peahens". And they don't have the luxurious plumage, either.
Nordaras.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh, well, yes, of course.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Say, Val, not to cast aspersion on you, but you seem to be moderately new to the art of being a Warlock. Are you, perchance, seeking a mentor or some such thing?
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh. My mistake. If you do change your mind, I would seek out one Aubrey Louvell. He holds no fondness for me, nor I for him, but he is more than competent, and in fact, already has one young protege, I believe. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I am, of course, even less competent a warlock than I am a mage, and could probably benefit from his knowledge, but I have no interest in such things. I thought I would pass it along, however. Something to tuck in your back pocket for if you need it.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh, yes. Very. Agressively so. Lots of teeth.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Ah. Yes.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I have an, how shall we say, aversion to wolves.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Hullo, ma'am. I don't suppose you were subjected to my sister earlier, as well? I've issued a blanket apology on her behalf, because I doubt she will ever do it herself.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Well, I'm dead, I have a horrible older sister, and I enjoy making friends with complete strangers.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] It normally doesn't go quite this well, frankly.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] *Glances warily at Snout*
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I've actually done that before. I could tell you the exact wine the Highlord favors, but I won't, because that's my trade secret.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Dogs, particularly wolves, are not particularly my favorites.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] She's certainly an impressive woman.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] In any case, I really ought to be about my business.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I travel all sorts of places, perhaps our paths will cross once more. If you decide you need to reach me urgently, Archmage Alecea in Dalaran will likely know where I am. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I do all sorts of things, none of which are any of your business.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Sazhe, you are a delight and I do hope you find some organization or mentor. I'll keep my ear out.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Val, good luck with the demons and the Worgen thing. I've heard it's an unique experience.
ordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Vuna, ah, have a nice day, I suppose.

Nordaras-ArgentDawn: So, Alecea! How has life been treating you, lately?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ooh, do tell! As much as I delight in attempting to follow the concept of international politics, I'm afraid I just can't keep up these days.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That may be the first time someone has called me dying a "smart" decision
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, perhaps one of the remaining Void Princes could get you sorted.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But please, enough about me, don't leave me waiting!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You are!? That's absolutely amazing, Alecea, I know how you love children!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn pauses for a moment, clearly thinking more thoroughly about this information.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Wait, Alecea, does that mean that--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Unless you have some sibling somewhere you've been hiding from me all this while, well, I assume you mean that the expectant parents would be Arithnan and Erileas?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, it would certainly be thrilling! Although, frankly, I find siblings overrated.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ugh. Don't remind me of them.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But I am truly happy for you, Alecea. And the happy couple, of course. Commander Silvershade seems like a very sensible person, to me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It's his title! I can't say he and I have spoken that often, the man deserves respect!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Several degrees removed from me!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: My best friend's husband's brother's paramour is hardly a relative, Alecea.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I-- well. I'd hate to presume anything before actually speaking to the man himself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You know I dislike addressing people informally without having earned their consent and friendship already. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Always happy to oblige, my friend.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh! Thank you. I'm thinking to return back to my usual ways, now that the Legion has been dealt with.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I didn't get the time I wanted in the Storm Peaks, and I think I need some time. A sort of sabbatical, if you will.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Get my head on right, think a bit, get back to being myself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I certainly hope not.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Of course, Alecea. I'll do what I can to stay in touch.
Nordaras?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm doing better than I was when I left Draenor. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm fragile, certainly, but I'm doing better than I used to be. And better than I thought I would be.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: The truth is, I spent all those years traveling alone, and I was happy! I think I just need some time to get back to that, without all the extra emotional baggage.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I have some actual closure now. I think I'll be okay.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: No. But in time, and with some wind and snow on my face, I think I'll be much refreshed.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I can't! I will still try to stay away from wolves, though.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Did I tell you I met a Worgen the other day, and I was mostly fine! I even talked to him! And didn't hyperventilate at all.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Not a bit! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He even shuffled a bit away to let me pick some flowers!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: They were important alchemical reagents, I'll have you know.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I was very proud of myself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh! I bumped into a handful of fledgling adventurers along the way. Odd, to be the intimidating person along the road, I suppose.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A few of these new void elves, and a Worgen along with them.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Nothing particularly interesting, I'm afraid. They are fascinating, though. More corrupted than most Shadow Priests, but more stable, too, it seems. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And it appears that the poor group ran into one recently-void corrupted Eiliniya Heartwood. I told them I was very sorry for that encounter.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I know! I was amazed at the fact that they were still standing at all, frankly.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ughhh. I doubt it. If anything, I'd suspect the shame of it would simply make her more prickly. You've seen how *I* get, and she's much worse.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I made them swear not to mention my continued existence to her.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, curiously so. No flickering in and out of states, at least not that I saw. Frankly, they seemed like perfectly normal elves, save for being purple and betentacled.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Very. I'd love to get a closer look at one of them at some point, although that may be difficult, considering that I've been apparently associated with the Horde, now. Alas.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, I'm certain I could...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: After all, I spoke to that group in Duskwood!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Mm. I'd love to understand, if only for, well, to understand it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: The Void is still such an unknown to me, and that makes it far more fearsome. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, yes. But I could do with knowing a little more.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I could *always* do with knowing a little more.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Of course! I will be very careful. And if anything goes wrong in a way that I can't solve myself, I'll let you know as soon as I can.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah-- Hm.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, it has been lovely to see you, Alecea, but I won't keep you any longer. There's plans I need to make. Arrangements, and such. But I promise not to go too long without at least sending a letter.
Nordaras-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm not leaving for good right this moment, but I will do my best.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You as well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That's probably fair.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Until later, my dear friend.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] You shall have to be more specific than simply "the" cat. I have several.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] The specific cat is *very* important.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I could introduce you, if you so wished.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] But really, I mostly wanted to ensure you were doing alright. Dealing with my sister can leave long-lasting scars, I can tell you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] And, well, adventuring can be, and often is, very stressful and lonely work. I wanted to see how you were handling things.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] You seem to still be intact. No more or less purple than last time I saw you, and not especially posessed, which is half the battle, really.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oho?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I'm very glad. I've never experienced his amiability, personally, of course, but that's directly primarily at undead.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Mmm. I was never even aligned with Sylvanas, although I don't think he cares.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh! Well, I was about to say the same thing about the Void Elves, actually. A pair of scientific marvels, we are.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I will have you know that my primary, ah, modus operandi, so to speak, is simply to travel and find interesting things, and at times, people.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] The interesting things keep travel from getting boring, and the people, well, they *often* keep things from being overwhelmingly lonely, as it were.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Although I doubt that's what you meant.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Not a job, really, so much as just what I decided to do.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Could you, now? Do tell.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh, but such things are certainly quite fun to gossip about.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] No, things in Quel'thalas rarely are
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] .
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] How many magisters had you seen, before the Scourge, actively leave Quel'thalas and enjoy the rest of the world? Because I can think of, ah, let me count-- three. And two of them are dear friends of mine. And one of them is also an Archmage--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] and had to spend quite a bit of time in Dalaran.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Political power and rank doesn't grant freedom. True magical or martial prowess and a well-filled coinpurse, now, that leads to freedom.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] You don't *need*  those titles. I never even reached the level of *Apprentice*, Valineth.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] And even that couldn't solve the fact that I was both incompetent and intolerable.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] *You* at least managed an apprenticeship. Clearly, you were more competent than I.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Competence *leads* to the money to do what you actually want.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] And if what you want is adventuring, well, there's good money to be made on that. I was self-sustained fairly shortly after I left Quel'thalas, simply because there's always people to buy stories, spells, artifacts, knowledge.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Then whatever is the issue?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] The point is, nobody would accept me as an apprentice. Even with my family's money, even with our house's good name.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] And now I'm-- I was one of the people allowed to go onto Argus and fight for our lives in the heart of the Legion's power.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I wasn't allowed to be an apprentice because I wasn't good enough. And now, I've stood in the halls of the titans themselves, looked a world soul in the eyes and *slain it*.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Don't get hung up on it. You have a good thing going here.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] It's-- That's not the point of my little motivational speech there, and you know it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] You're just picking out the bits of what I've said that you can hurt yourself with and fight me over. I should know, I'm very good at it, too.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I-- Ugh. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I can't even be mad at you for this, because I know damn well I had to get this same lecture not too long ago, but I'm not sure how Elivan put *up* with it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] He's wonderful. At least 70% of his rocker, but that's neither here nor there.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Hmm. I suppose that's fair.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh! I offer the same, of course. I'm testing an enchantment I borrowed from the Nightborne to allow me to receive mail wherever I am, so if you think of more later-- don't hesitate to let me know!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] But, ah, I have a friend who is a shadow priest and he's quite afflicted with *whispers*. Do you experience the same thing? How *are* you so stable?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Very interesting! So you stay aware of the voices, but don't focus on them? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Intriguing. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Ah, it would make sense, that the influence would be worse whilst resting and unable to consciously resist the influence.... It makes sense!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Well, you seem to be at least moderately functional, so that's good, yes?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn is grinning a little bit-- he's not being mean, he's goofin'.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] *Nordaras is grinning a little bit-- he's not being mean, he's goofing.*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Really, it's all one can hope for in this day and age.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] An admirable outlook.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Mm. I suppose you're right.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Not always easy, when there's things in the past you'd rather cling to.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] That is technically and officially correct.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Well, that's admirable.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Believe me, I tried. Or, I would have if I didn't think he'd kill me for questioning him.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Mm. I suppose not.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Well, that's a matter of opinion! Are you doing research? Because if so, you're a researcher.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] And, of course, I do believe in returning favors, so please, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh, goodness. That-- How was that? Some of them are moderately tolerable, and some are not.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Oh, good!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Sorry, do continue.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] I certainly hope so!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Hm. I can't say I have extreme familiarity with Worgen Death Knights-- I tend to avoid them, frankly. But a Death Knight isn't just a regular undead.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] You may notice that I, like most of the Death Knights, am neither incorporeal, nor am I actively rotting.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] The magic that goes into the more sophisticated undead is far more intense than your run of the mill zombies.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] It requires more effort from whoever is raising them, but has significant payoff in the intelligence, power, and general functionality of the individual.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] It's likely that Worgen have an immunity to the Plague, but the Plague is a blunt tool for taking out large swaths of population at a time, and raising them into mindless slaves.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] The more personal, directed magic wielded by the Lich King, or potentially other extremely powerful undead, could supercede the immunity granted by the Worgen curse.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Of course, I don't know for certain. But it's the most likely solution I can think of.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn says: [Thalassian] Well, this has been lovely-- and don't be a stranger-- but I do have travel plans to contend with. I will speak with you later, though, I'm certain.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I-- uh.. Hey, Commander?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel raises an eyebrow sort of like he's trying to figure out if he's being insulted or not* I... suppose? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I-- yes? I mean, technically, but it's-- how did you--? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn stares down at his hand with a look of Betrayal. How *could* you. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I didn't-- Hm. I didn't realize.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well I've never.. stabbed myself. I don't think. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Great! Great. Always wanted to be ahead of the curve-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel makes A Face* That's what I *get,* I suppose. Swords weren't exactly supposed to be our specialty. Sort of in the 'if you have to use your sword you're probably already dead' way. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And the Scourge didn't care about *technique.*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Maybe not, but you're a lot *better* than me-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And not just time to practice! You've flung yourself into practically every conflict Quel'thalas has been involved in and have *survived*-- what you say *matters.*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: All due respect, but I.. wasn't there. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: It would be *very* impressive if I had been on Outland--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But more to the point, if you've got.. pointers, I would be very grateful to hear them! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I don't exactly get a lot of people offering to teach me.. anything, really.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh, I-- hadn't thought of that. To study daggers instead of larger swords. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah, I've.. always leaned towards a more agile fighting style, I guess. Not that I'd really thought about it, until now. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: We always prioritized being quick over strength, in the Farstriders. Which you know, I'm sure. I've just been compensating for my form with the armor, I guess. Along with the fact I can take a frankly absurd amount of hits because of the.. what I am. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But it's something to think about! Thank you for pointing it out to me, otherwise I.. never would have noticed, I'm sure. I haven't even picked up a bow in years, I didn't.. know that any of that training was still there. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Maybe. Though it's not exactly doing me a lot of good.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm not-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm not even old!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That's a rather grand assumption, sir. But I'll take your word for it. 
Kelahnias shrugs at you.  Who knows?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, my track record with survival isn't exactly the greatest. 
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Maybe so! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Maybe it's all in the sword technique! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Staying at home, and staying out of whatever nonsense the Horde and Alliance have decided to get up to. 
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias pets Chao.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn grimaces.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Sylvanas, among other things. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Not yet. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But I.. thank you for your time, Commander. And if there are any other tips you can think to give me, I would love to hear them! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I.. would appreciate that, really! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I.. always sort of idolized you, you know. Growing up. Although I'm sure I wasn't the only one. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm.. still a little fuzzy on the specific details of what happened. I'm sure I could ask Lorsaen at some point, but I'm not sure how much I actually want to know. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But I'd say you made the right decision, judging by the fact you're still standing here, sir. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: does erileas know there's still a lich king???
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the Twenty Five People who showed up to icc and the ebon blade are just sitting on that secret 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn left channel.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, you mean little old me? You flatter me. Come, sit.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It's a turn of phrase, Arithnan. Just an expression.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I could look at this city forever.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Here are there. I never thought I'd actually see it. Or the Broken Isles in general. Rumor used to be that they were completely lost.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, one could say the same about Pandaria. Although, we knew this island still existed; I don't know why nobody ever tried to check on it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I don't know why *I* never came here.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I suppose there was enough to do elsewhere.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I haven't the faintest idea, although I'm still a bit sad I missed it. I was otherwise occupied at the time, of course.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm not a man to miss the chance to visit another plane of existence or another planet!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, from what I've gathered, anything of cultural significance from Draenor was ruined when it fractured. Not much that I would find interesting for too long, although seeing how the land changed...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Maybe at some other point. I was speaking with Alecea recently, and it seems you will be rather too busy to play tour guide in a handful of months.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, I do enjoy the ethereals.
Nordaras somehow hadn't heard* Oh, uh. Yeah. Guess you're right. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Nordaras gives Arithnan a sidelong glance and rests a hand on his knee.* And how are we feeling about that?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Nordaras leans around in front of Arithnan* Is that so?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Very brave of you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Arithnan-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I know how much Alecea loves children. I do not. You don't have to do-- all this to try and convince me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I appreciate it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Nordaras frowns into the distance* Arithnan. Do you even *want* to be a parent?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Nordaras continues to frown*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I think you... need to figure that out first.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Minus the fear, minus the anxieties about failure-- does the idea of having children bring you joy? At all?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hah.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I think that it's probably fine to be scared. Every time you start something new, it's scary. And I've never voluntarily done anything I couldn't just leave when I wanted to.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm not sure where I was going with that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That's what I'm here for.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, ah. Moving on, I suppose. Or, moving forwards, I suppose, which is similar but not quite the same.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I think I need to remember how to be okay alone. I was fine alone for a very long time. Now, I feel myself trying to cling to anyone I could possibly lean on. And it isn't me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Back to Northrend, actually. There's some impressive and beauitful Titan structures up in the Storm Peaks, and I never got as much time with them as I would have liked.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I enjoy it! I feel it clears my head.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, you can stay where there's no snow, and I will go hiking through the snow and the wind on my own.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: The Legion does seem to enjoy fire quite a bit. Although, to be frank, "The Snowy Legion" doesn't sound quite the same, does it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, I suppose so.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Anyway, the Scourge never went up to Ulduar, despite my repeated suggestions. I doubt I'll bump into any of them there.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, yes. It's a good thing I wasn't listened to, in that case. It could have been disastrous.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But-- *Nordaras sighs.* Please just think about what I asked. I have faith in you, as your unofficial friend-with-benefits, but, Arithnan, the worst thing you could do is try to be a parent despite not wanting it--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And there's a difference between not liking kids, not wanting kids, and worrying that you won't be a good parent. I know you aren't one of those three things. But...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I don't know. I know you don't want a lecture but-- Well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I just don't want to see you and your children be miserable because you did something you didn't want.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Nordaras nods.* That's good, then.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Now, that's something I'd pay to see. The great Commander, doing something other than be either stoic or stern?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Mm?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I think official titles have to be given by a governmental or monarchical entity.
Nordaras.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, my apologies, your Grand High Poobahness. I didn't realize.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hm? Oh, my apologies, I was mistaken, ah, High Chancellor of Citydom.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Nordaras actually cracks a small smile for the first time today*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'll admit, I have no idea what the actual rank of a High Chancellor is, in relationship to other rulers.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I suppose it must.
Nordaras, or all these smiles and laughter might make someone think we're *friends!* 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A tragedy, in truth.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Whatever is this world coming to?
Nordaras' head closer for a second so he can press a small kiss onto his temple* 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Nordaras closes his eyes and squeezes Arithnan's knee.* Thank you. For being here, and for understanding all of.... all of my everything. I couldn't even begin to explain it all to most anyone else, without being, at best, mocked.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *He's talking very quietly, like, slightly above Elivan volume levels*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I-- I think friends is the best idea, for now. I can't-- I had to break things off with Nihhan, you know? I simply don't think I'm in a place to do much else than friendship, at the moment.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And even that, I must warn you, I am about to become abysmal at.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will be better than I have been, though. The Nightborne have some fascinating advancements with mail technology, so I should, at least, be contactable.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I think it will help. I just need time to clear my head. To just, if you will pardom me mixing metaphors, let all my wounds breathe and air out for a moment.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I rather thought so.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, I-- I don't want to keep you too long, Arithnan, and going on an extended sabbatical is much more logistically difficult when people actually *know* you. There are so many people to explain myself to! Utterly ridiculous.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Look at us. Properly integrated with civilization and everything. Disguisting. I should be rolling in my own grave right now.
Nordaras. It'd be a real fuckin' shame to never see you again. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I don't intend to make a habit of dying in horrible ways in Northrend. I'm running rather low on hands already.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Don't be too much of a stranger. I'd hate to go to all the trouble to set up these Nightborne enchantments and only ever get letters from one person, you know.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I appreciate your sacrifices.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Nordaras grins and kisses Arithnan on the cheek, then bites his ear* Oh, don't you start with that nonsense! Next you'll be ranting about preparedness and then I will never be able to speak with you again.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I think you'll survive.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: We've only just earned the ability to move throughout Suramar once again, and I fear that they are about to throw the pair of us right back out again.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Then I suppose you'll have to endeavor to restrain yourself, somewhat. Or I suppose I could get creative with sheets and pillows?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, absolutely. Either way. *Nordaras rests his head on Arithnan's shoulder and peers up at him.*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Mhmm. That's me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: (he wasn't even TRYING to be sexy he was trying to like, put a stop the demon hunter jokes
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Mm. They don't seem that fond of flying in this city, although who knows what the Nightborne could do with magic. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Rather convenient of whoever lives here to just leave a perfectly good bed laying about. I could certainly do with just listening to the ocean and the city for a few moments. Or hours. Or something.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Or something.
Nordaras had something to with the whole.... physical body thing, and he's probably as boring as it gets for a kid. I don't think he's got anything to say that's both "interesting" and "appropriate".
Nordaras asked *Taffy* what she wanted. Treating her like a person, yknow?
Nordaras doesn't make a practice of mistreating people unless they've earned it, which Taffy certainly has not. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hullo, Thal!
Nordaras* Hello, Nordaras-- a pleasure to see you again. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And you. I hope I've found you good health and good spirits today?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, well, I suppose I am in a good mood, at the moment. I have a new trip that's almost fully planned, and you know I'm at my best with the open road before me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You know full well that it would require an entire gaggle of people to prevent me from telling anyone and everyone about my travels, Thal.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Back to Northrend, if you can believe it. I never quite made it up to Storm Peaks for more than a quick scan of the land, which is an utter shame.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I stopped by briefly, but there was just never enough time....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But, I must say, I have found myself much more interested in the Titans and their intentions for this world, of late...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Every console, every inch of carving, every little machine and doorway holds innumerable secrets that have the potential to change the course of history forever!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You are absolutely right, although I fear I may not be able to give it the attention it deserves. I have been not myself, of late, and I hope that the isolation, cold air, and intellectual stimulation will have me feeling a bit more myself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I should hate to be both dead, and on the receiving end of her wrath. I'm truly not certain which fate would be worse.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, I will! You know how I love my notes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That I am!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Most people have no respect for simple academic inquiry. A tragedy, truly.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Retire, possibly? Find a new planet? Sit on the beach and sip margaritas until we die of boredom?
ordaras-ArgentDawn shudders.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I have nothing against them, but I'm of the opinion that any cocktail worth making is on fire. Although, sometimes margaritas have tiny swords and umbrellas in those, and I do enjoy those.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I am very fond of tiny umbrellas.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, is that what she does with them? She's always asking them to bring them back for her.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I assumed she was making little displays, or something.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Maybe they're to give shade for the birds?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Alecea, doing something odd just because it's funny? She would *never*!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Truly slanderous.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, is that how it works?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will keep that in mind.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You know she is far more frightening that you are. If she demands, I will be unable to resist her too strongly.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, I should probably be on my way, Thal. Many stops to make before I hit the road. Or ocean, as it were.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Dalaran would be lovely, I think. Easiest place to find whoever you seek.
Kelahnias to join your group.
elahnias joins the party.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn joined channel.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That's quite the impressive trick, Frostlord! I have never seen a man fish quite like *that* before.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I-- what-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh, it's-- you. Why are you-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: What's wrong with me *fishing*?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You are managing to go ice fishing in Quel'thalas. In April. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: It's not *ice* fishing, it's perfectly *normal* fishing. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It's just not how most would opt to do it, that's all.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But the water is deeper if you're not standing along the shore-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Anyway, I didn't come here about your fishing habits. Hello, Tabitha, by the way.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And I don't exactly have a *boat,* you know! I mean, I don't need one-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, I'm certain you could *acquire* a boat, if you so wished. I'm not sure how this conversation wandered into this territory, frankly.
elahnias-ArgentDawn | Taffy waves excitedly, and peeps out a 'Hello, Mr. Nordaras!' She's currently sitting in the sand and making formations with shells. Her current message says 'I bet my Dad won't read this,' and clearly took a lot of effort to make. 
elahnias frowns with disappointment at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Sorry, I wasn't really expecting to *see you here.* What did you.. want, exactly? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That is a-- lovely grasp of penmanship you have there, Tabitha. Shellmanship, I suppose?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, anyway, Mr. Bigglesworth is, well, quite the ladies man, and I find myself in the position of having far more kittens on my hands than I could possibly do anything with. And I know you're a dog person, *but* dogs do not keep the mice away. I thought--
Kel makes a face that says he knows *exactly* what she's done, but thinks it's more fun not to intervene. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, if Tabitha wanted to pick a kitten for the home, or-- or something like that.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm sorry, you're offering us a cat? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will not foist a cat upon you if you don't want it, of course, but, I just thought-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I got Alecea and Thal a cat when they got married. Housewarming gift, and all that. 
Kel and Stare at him, expectantly. 
elahnias sighs at Taffy.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I... suppose it can't hurt. On the condition that *Tabitha* is responsible enough to take care of it-- 
elahnias-ArgentDawn | Taffy nods, excitedly. "I'll take care of it!!! Promise!!" 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Who, then, am I, to deny my daughter a cat when it's being offered. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, come along, then.
ordaras-ArgentDawn seems real nervous about letting people in his home, which is a cluttered mess, but he does it anyway because that's called growth. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Your have..... a lot more decorations than I would have imagined. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn leads Taffy over to a crate lined with pillows and blankets, containing Toasty and an assortment of black and white kittens.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I collect things. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And sometimes Alecea gives me things.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I can see that! I just didn't... anticipate it. 
elahnias-ArgentDawn also leans over and tells Taffy not to break anything while they're here. She's got a physical form now, she has to be responsible!!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You are not the first person to be surprised that I don't live in a home made entirely of stark marble with a four poster bed on a dramatic dais.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Um. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn clears his throat, trying to remember to not be a prickly bitch.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: No, it's nice! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, well. Thank you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Tabitha, come say hello to mama cat-- Her name is Toasty, don't reach for the kittens just yet-- Just hold your hand out to her so she can smell you.
elahnias-ArgentDawn | Taffy is clearly very excited, but she tries her best to do exactly as Nordaras says. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn | Toasty buts her head against Taffy's hand, rubbing her face against her, in typical cat fashion.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: There you are. *Nordaras scratches Toasty between the shoulderblades* I think she knows you'll be good to her babies. Is there one you like best?
ordaras-ArgentDawn scoops up Toasty, who meows slightly in complaint, but he needs her out of the way for Operation Kitten Retrieval.
elahnias-ArgentDawn | Taffy giggles happily, but looks incredibly conflicted on which one to choose. 
elahnias-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: seems to seriously debate for a moment, before pursing her lips and pointing at a Lil Baby Siamese Cat. "... This one." 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, one of the ones who takes after their father. Probably a good choice; they should be a bit more, ah, sturdy. Not that any of my cats *aren't*; they're all under the effects of a low-grade enchantment to ensure they live longer.
ordaras-ArgentDawn scoops up the kitten and carefully passes it to Taffy.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Now, the more you hold the cat now, the more it will enjoy being handled and cuddled as an adult, but you always want to make sure you have all of a cat's feet supported when you pick it up. That way it knows to trust you won't drop it.
elahnias-ArgentDawn | Taffy she kinda shrugs, and then gets really, really excited when she gets the cat, but is clearly trying to play it cool. "I just liked him because his eyes are like my Dad's, and mine, so we all match!" 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, well, that's-- Very astute.
ordaras-ArgentDawn looks up to Kel with a nervous expression, like, "Please help me I cannot talk to children"
elahnias-ArgentDawn is grinning right up until the point Nordaras addresses him. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *He half-whispers, half-mouths* Oh, please, you're doing fine-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Let's-- I'll get a few things to make it easier for the kitten, moving to a new home-- You two, decide what to-- name it, I suppose.
elahnias-ArgentDawn presses a kiss onto Taffy's head and kind of scritches the kitty very, very carefully. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn bustles off to gather a pillow and blanket that will smell like his home, as well as a glass jar with cat food in it. He's trying to look Extra Busy.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, Taffy, do you want to name it now? Or wait until we get home, and you can ask your Papa what he thinks? I'm sure you could come up with a.... very fun name together. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn | Taffy thinks very seriously for a second, chewing her lip. "I think.... he should be Jonesy." She cuddles the kitten against her chest and absolutely refuses to explain that choice at all.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Uh. Alright? Jonesy it is. 
elahnias-ArgentDawn raises his eyebrows at Nordaras like he's just kind of confused. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn shrugs. The man has a cat named Toasty. He cannot possibly criticize anyone on cat names.
elahnias-ArgentDawn it's a good cat name, nordaras. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A-- lovely name, Miss Tabitha. Shall we take him back to your home and see how he settles in?
elahnias-ArgentDawn | Taffy says: Yeeeeees pleeeeaaase! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel kind of catches Nordaras as they're making the walk back home* Was that... all you wanted? To give us a cat? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, well, mostly. I'm about to hit the road again. Off to my usual tricks, you know.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel narrows his eyes and is clearly just caught a little offguard* I... see? It's a.. kind gesture, Nordaras. I didn't realize you liked us enough to give us a... cat. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I don't believe in homes without cats, Kel. I suppose many feel the same about dogs, or children, but, ah-- That's not the point. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: No, I should think not. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You have been considerably less unkind to me than you had cause to, and you gave me a chance for some desperately needed closure. You have, whether you know or care, changed me significantly for the better. That's-- 
elahnias is surprised by your actions.
ordaras-ArgentDawn shrugs, clearly not sure what to say or how to say it.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Thank you, Nordaras. The feeling is mutual, at least partially. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn smiles very uncomfortably.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You are a lot... kinder than most would give you credit for. That's worth something. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, no, have you been speaking with Elivan? Did I tell you, he told me off for-- for what felt like *hours*. Really, you are absolutely going to ruin my reputation, running about, saying things like that.
elahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Elivan? No, I talk to Elivan very rarely. He sort of scares me, to be frank. Though I would say that managing to get him to tell you off is an incredible feat in and of itself-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Besides,* if I'm ruining anyone's reputation, it's only how you regard yourself. I would never dream of telling someone else that you're actually quite sensible and nice. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I do appreciate it. And-- Since you're actually *in* Quel'thalas here, I feel obligated to warn you about my family. One of my sisters is apparently a Void Elf, you won't need to worry about her.
elahnias-ArgentDawn looks visibly disgusted. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But the rest of them-- If you see anyone who looks or sounds *anything* like me, out and about, do yourself a favor and run very quickly the other way. Or walk quickly. They can smell fear.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: The fact that I am here at all is a miracle. If I'm expected to interact with anyone that's not Lorsaen, I really can't speak to their safety. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It would be no great loss.
elahnias snorts derisively at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: A happy family, clearly! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm only partially joking, there. There is a reason I'm the way I am, and I have tried very hard to be less horrible than they are, if that gives you any indication.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Though that does bring up another point of why I am legitimately shocked you're standing in front of me, which is I never, ever though I would see you in Quel'thalas-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... That, uh, tells me something, for sure. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, I wasn't going to put a kitten into a *cage* and *mail* it to you, like some sort of barbarian!
elahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Absolutely not! But still, it's weird. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I do intend to leave shortly. But, well, I intend to more or less fall off the map for a few months at least, and I've been letting pretty much everyone I know in on my plans. You, I figure, might get suspicious, if you heard what I was up to third hand.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *That* I appreciate. I would like to think I've got enough to worry about right now. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I-- well, yes.
elahnias lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I never got the time in Storm Peaks that I wanted; I find the Titans fascinating, but, well, I was-- you know. Anyway, I intend to return there, and take my time with the Vaults.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Not that I'd think you were up to any *particularly* shady shit. I'd like to think I know you well enough. But I also get paranoid. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, and I figured that you would be particularly unhappy if all you heard what that I had wandered off to Northrend again.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, we all wander off to Northrend now and again. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But, uh, have fun... messing with Titan things? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, I intend to.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Have fun with your... fish. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel almost groans. He doesn't want this to be A Thing.* ... Yes, well, we've all got ways to deal with anxiety. And Lorsaen says it's good to have hobbies that don't involve... large-scale murder. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A wise man.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Um.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, y'know. 
ordaras-ArgentDawn fidgets awkardly.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Is this you saying you want to leave? Because you can. Y'know. Do that. It's fine. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I-- Yes. Um, I do, in theory, still have the ability to get mail, so if something goes horribly wrong with the cat, do let me know, but otherwise, ah-- Yes. I'm-- off to Northrend, I suppose.
elahnias-ArgentDawn nods slowly.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Hopefully we'll be okay. Hopefully. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: If Taffy and I have managed to keep Lorsaen mostly alive this long, we should be able to handle a cat. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And, to be fair, the cat is partially dead to begin with, so, who knows?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yes, he'll fit right in-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, well-- So long, I suppose. Be happy, Frostlord. 
elahnias smiles at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You too, Nordaras. Don't get too cold up there. 
Kelahnias.  Farewell!
elahnias waves goodbye to you.  Farewell!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: (cause i took rill there the other day..
elahnias cheers at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Hey. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: So, uh, I have some news-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Mhmm. We have a cat now. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: We have. A cat.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *He kinda picks up Jonesy and just holds him up*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: See? Cat.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Taffy picked him out-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I don't know that she was really picking out a *dead* pet. Nordaras just took her to pick a kitten. 
Nordaras... Shoulda guessed.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah. That's... sort of his thing. Apparently he thought that, because we have a house now, we have to have a cat. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: The *frightening* thing is that he knew where our house *was.*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel gives a very resigned sigh* I *guess.* 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But it scared the shit out of me. Like, on a list of things I was prepared to handle yesterday, that definitely wasn't on it.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But he.. wanted to offer a cat, as well as to say he was leaving for Northrend for a bit. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah, no kidding. I mean, I appreciate it, I guess. He said some very kind things, as far as Nordaras goes. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I was going to ask! How you're doing, how you're... uh, things went. I missed you. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: As far as missing other things, I'm not entirely in the loop myself. The amount of people who actually talk to me on a regular basis is pretty limited. 
elahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, you know, it's apparently common practice to sleep with the first thing you see in a new place. 
elahnias shrugs at you.  Who knows?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Who's to say! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But please, tell me all the elf drama. 
elahnias-ArgentDawn looks a little dumbstruck for a moment. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: We-- what? 
elahnias lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: How... exciting. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh, great! That's great. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: -- What the *fuck.* 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Guess we're not letting Elivan in to see the Sunwell anytime soon, huh? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .....
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But *do* you?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yes, well, you know everyone. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But I'm-- uh, confused? So Elivan doesn't.. qualify, as whatever a Void Elf is? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: There's too many damn elves. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh, so they're blood elves pretending to be night elves. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That's.... weird.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Not anymore evil than usual, I don't think. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And the number of things she's fallen off of have been kept to a relative minimum! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: She, also, missed you. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Have we? I guess I'd believe it. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Yeah. Definitely. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I had a moment, while you were gone, that I thought that I.. maybe couldn't do it, but it was just a moment. Being away from everyone else helps. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And I *think* Taffy likes it, too. I can't be sure, she can be an enigma, but I think. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... You know, I just had an idea. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, she's a young girl. And isn't... a ghost, anymore. She needs *schooling.* 
elahnias nods at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, listen! We know plenty of smart people! Here's my idea-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: We ask Alecea and Thal to tutor her! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yes, exactly! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And, like, I dare you to name two people more qualified when it comes to academics-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I have those, upon occasion.
elahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That's one of the better ones, to be sure. 
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I mean, for me, anyways. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *You* made a very, very grave mistake. 
elahnias blows you a kiss.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You say that now! Just give it another five years! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You'll be finally fed up with nearly freezing to death every day-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I never actually told you what happened with Tabitha, did I? Up in Northrend? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Nordaras, uh, asked me to go up to Northrend with him. Something about putting all of the pieces of Arthas' soul back together so he could finally... move on, or something. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Uh huh. Taffy just happened to be with me, at the time. And got very attached to the possibility of losing her... friend, forever. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Specifically, the, uh, small ghost we met in Icecrown. He went by Mathias, I think. Apparently Tabitha and him played together, or something. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah, it took me a second. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Anyways. Mathias and Arthas, same person, sort of. So you lose one, you lose the other. Taffy was concerned. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: So she came with me to Northrend! And Arthas did.... that. 
elahnias shrugs at you.  Who knows?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I don't-- I don't know! Because they were friends? Because he felt bad about murdering a six-year-old girl in the streets of her home? How am I supposed to know? 
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Yeah. Yeah. She deserves it. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Lorsaen. Something's been bothering me. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, beyond the normal things that bother me. Which is an endless list. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But. Word is that the faction conflict might... respark. Pick up again. 
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Which I don't... I couldn't care less. But I know you *can't.* 
elahnias-ArgentDawn leans over on Lorsaen's shoulder this time, and nods, very slightly. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Hey, Lorsaen? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... I love you. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And this is nice. I like being home. 
elahnias blows you a kiss.
Kelahnias.
Nordaras would have some ideas for hobbies that you would find more...exciting.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *great* place for a phylactery
elahnias shrugs.  Who knows?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: there's just a lot of opportunities to ruin everything with undead?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: playing with unnatural forces and all that. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, because the *first* time you did this you were your normal old self *anyways!*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: besides, this is more fun than the *normal* sorts of time shenanigans. killing scourge is much better than helping them.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i've *always* had cool swords, lorsaen.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and extra cursed.
elahnias-ArgentDawn makes a face.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that seems like a design flaw. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i *earned* them, you mean!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm.... not entirely sure they'll let me in. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no worries. it's not as if i have somewhere else to be-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just, maybe not *in* light's hope. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... hey?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: nice.. hat
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, 'proud' is not a word i would associate with you
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i meant it as a compliemtn!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and i think you look dashing in anything you wear, even if it's a goofy hat
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i think it's a fire hazzard
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: don't catch your hair on fire, it'd be a shame
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you know what we should do?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: take the time to finally *put out* stratholme.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: there's surely *something* we could do. magic and all. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, but again, i think it's a hazard.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: smoke in your lungs, or something.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: try not to die.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, well, sometimes i'm worried you don't try hard enough!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: do i now?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i do wonder why we haven't gotten around to clearing out the plaguelands' scourge
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: a handful of cultists with some pocket change and somehow they're *still* running around killing people--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... uh
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: hm
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: too many crisicles, or maybe the argent crusade is just getting *lazy.*
elahnias-ArgentDawn grins. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: clearing out plaguelands' scourge is sort of like our first date, if you want to get generous with things.
elahnias-ArgentDawn frowns.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, it's not that, it's-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, not all of us are good at pretending to be 'regular married people with kids' 
elahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, i know, but-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, you at least have the choice.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: believe me, if i could go fishing every day of my life and make that *work,* i would. you know that. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... i know. i'm sorry. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm sorry, dear. you've done your best.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: in a world where the ebon blade hasn't completely fucked up any diplomatic relations we've ever had, maybe we could have done *something--*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no. there's no war where innocents don't die. and not with sylvanas involved. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: any "innocent" that dies is another footsoldier in her army. it's like fighting arthas all over again. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: and as optimistic as i'd like to be in a "better world," the ebon blade has never held diplomatic sway over *any* faction. we're not relevant past our usefulness on a battlefield. and, as hard as it might be to admit, neither are spy organizations- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the horde and alliance would much rather use you to pull out weaknesses than to maintain whatever fragile peace they've got.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe with a more sensible warchief.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: sylvanas, however, puts herself above diplomacy. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i hope, dear, that you're right. 
elahnias-ArgentDawn makes an amused sound. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that'd be nice, wouldn't it? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm certain we could get *most* of the ebon blade on board, really--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm fairly certain alecea and thal would do nearly *anything* you asked them to. they just like you.
elahnias nods at you.
elahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: what, like kind of replacement?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: some*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i, personally, think he lucked out, then. you are much more fun to be around than arithnan. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: operation fix the flameleaf family?
elahnias laughs.
elahnias cackles maniacally at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: lorsaen, i would never make fun of you-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: regardless of your silly hats. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: though i would be lying if it didn't add just a *bit* of levity to the conversation. 
elahnias blows you a kiss.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe. they do suit you, in a way. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: you know what i have *never* understood?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ...... yes. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: but also,
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: just... people like *this.*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the cult of the damned members and the like. i just don't *get it.*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: then go... study the void, or something. don't drag the dead into it.
elahnias laughs.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: he *would.* 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: one of his blood vessels bursts every time you even *mention* one of the scourge 'professors.'
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well, luckily he doesn't need them.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: so instead, he just complains until you wish your ears would fall off!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, i'm certain that's *exactly* what he was thinking
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: well he did *give me* a perfectly reasonable explanation at the time
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, you were in *silvermoon*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: because lor'themar refuses to let you ever be home to rest-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yes, dear, i'm well aware of how talented you are, but it doesn't help anyone if you work yourself to death. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm of half a mind to have words with him--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: maybe the regent-lord should hire more than one elf!
elahnias lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: that's *another* thing i just don't get! the scarlet crusade!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn left channel.
Nordaras? 
Nordaras.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that's good to hear, though.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ...?? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, please, continue,
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no, roja, that's not insensitive, 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: you're just fine. have you been doing anything fun in our brief respite?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... taalle-pally?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh, be nice to him, he's being friendly!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i find it delightful!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: well, just "be" somewhere that you won't hurt ysera's champion, here.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: taalle,
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i don't particularly care what you threaten *me* with, but the archdruid has done nothing to incur your wrath, other than being *friendly*. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: can we *please* not start--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: nordaras, don't encourage her 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: i was endeavouring to the exact opposite, actually, but very well.
elahnias lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: no! no killing each other. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *please*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: .... of course!
Nordaras-TheScryers: Val! How are you doing? 
Nordaras! You're alive! 
Nordaras-TheScryers: In the general sense, yes.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Northrend has few enough secrets left to kill me with, although not for lack of trying.
Nordaras-TheScryers: I quite like the cold, but yes, it was certainly cold. Especially in Storm Peaks. The altitude is non-negligible.
Nordaras-TheScryers: It's very convenient, but, truth be told, I've always enjoyed the cold.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Oh, all sorts of fun things! Shall we sit and have a drink?
Nordaras-TheScryers: We're not supposed to, nor do we need to, but nothing will keep me from a nice glass of wine.
Nordaras-TheScryers: So. Where do I even *start* with Northrend?
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well, as I might have mentioned, I initially went to Northrend several years before anything with the undead really began. But my time was tragically cut short, leaving me with almost no exploration of Storm Peaks-- home of some of the most magnificent
Nordaras-TheScryers: Titan ruins around.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well, in most places where there's Titan structures, there's Old Gods, or at least, their minions. But-- *Nordaras leans forward, conspiratorially* There's actually an entire Old God imprisoned there. Not just minions or cultists!
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well. Plenty of minions and cultusts.
Nordaras-TheScryers: *Nordaras sits back, clearly excited about his discovery*
Nordaras-TheScryers: Yes! It's been properly imprisoned again, now, thanks to the good old Heroes of Azeroth, although I did have a runin with a handful of cultists who seemed intent on undoing that.
Nordaras-TheScryers: They seem to have been quite thoroughly killed, though, if it helps you sleep better. Yogg-Saron is staying put.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Oh, I did my best, but found myself quite overwhelmed, sadly. A rather.... strapping gentleman came to my aid, however.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Hmm. I was in a bit of a bad situation, quite out of my depth, and a quite handsome human man came to my rescue. Not that I was fully aware of it when he first showed up, but I quickly came to my senses.
Nordaras-TheScryers: The kind that's very good at hitting things very hard with a sword. 
Nordaras-TheScryers: Very much part of my woefully predictable type when it comes to humans, too.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Yes. Convient, hm? But he was quite blantantly not dead, and I, sadly, don't keep much but cat food in my pantry, so I portaled him off to Dalaran. I do hope he made it.
Nordaras-TheScryers: I enjoy surprises just fine! But I find myself looking towards the same sorts of people wherever I end up...
Nordaras-TheScryers: It's the one mage-y thing I'm properly decent at, in fact! 
Nordaras-TheScryers: I would, but I haven't the faintest clue of to *where*. He had that... Lordaeronean look about him, you know, big, blond, swordy sorts, but I sincerely doubt Sylvanas has kept up on mailing addresses for her living constituents.
Nordaras-TheScryers has joined the guild.
Nordaras-TheScryers: I... suppose so. Perhaps a local post office might have some luck...
Nordaras-TheScryers: You're right of course, it's just... very silly of me, fussing over things so badly.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Oh. How curious. He sounds like an utterly delightful fellow!
Nordaras-TheScryers: I'll have to seek him out while I'm here, then.
Nordaras-TheScryers: I'm just worrying over nothing, don't concern yourself too badly with it. I don't think it's unreasonable to hope that my rescuer made it to safety, hm?
Nordaras-TheScryers: I will keep that in mind! I'm always happy to meet new and interesting people.
Nordaras-TheScryers: It's a rare and delightful feeling, isn't it? So rarely are people even willing to let me try--
Nordaras-TheScryers: Oh! Theon, I believe. I have his last name in my journal somewhere, let me look...
Nordaras-TheScryers: *Nordaras pulls out a leatherbound journal and flips back through the pages a little ways* Derland! Theon Derland. Seemed nice enough, if a bit... confused by my overall demeanor, and not being overly bothered by-- well, you know how cultists are.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Yes, it's written right here! Why, do you know him? 
Nordaras-TheScryers: Did the man you met have an eyepatch?
Nordaras-TheScryers: Crotchety? Hm. He must have been in a different mood when we each met him. He was a bit guarded, around Charnagma, but certainly not.... overly grumpy. Although he didn't speak much about himself. He seemed mostly concerned that I was alright.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well, that sounds-- odd. Did he tell you why or-- Oh, it was the Void thing, wasn't it? He really seemed to hate Charnagma.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well, yes, but I think you're perfectly enjoyable company, and I found him at least moderately enjoyable as well. Perhaps I can attempt to talk him around.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well, if it makes you feel any better, most people feel the same way about me. There's quite a few people who absolutely detest me, and, to some extent, I understand their reasoning.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Exactly! You get it, at least.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well, that's not necessarily a bad thing. She's horrible, I don't know why you would *want* to speak with her.
Nordaras-TheScryers: That's absolutely phenomenal, and utterly sounds like her.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well, you can't get the Murder Row part, but don't let dreams be dreams. Perhaps you could choose to be a... I don't know, a Mages' Quarter Hussy?
Nordaras-TheScryers: Chase your rainbow, Val.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Ah, yes. That does throw a damper on Operation Hussy, doesn't it?
Nordaras-TheScryers: And how *are* things with your Dedwall?
Nordaras-TheScryers: Caverns of Time? *Nonsense*? Absolutely ridiculous. I will be having a talk with him. ....No, I will not do that. I may send him a letter to tell him to be more open to adventure.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well, drinking through Dalaran is also enjoyable, in its own way. Not as much fun alone, though.
Nordaras-TheScryers: How odd.
Nordaras-TheScryers: I think he might still enjoy it more with *you* there. That's the whole point of a relationship, isn't it? Finding someone whose company you enjoy more than being alone?
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well, that sounds like impressive alcohol.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Sounds like it could either be fun or horrible.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Well, perhaps you should ask him. He might not want to bother you, while you're off doing important things. Don't let him feel forgotten.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Say, would you walk with me to the post office in the Trade District? Perhaps they can aid me with finding wherever Theon is. 
Nordaras-TheScryers: Damn. Closed for the night, and this crazy old man is talking about swords outside. I suppose my letter writing shall have to wait for the morning.
Nordaras-TheScryers: An excellent idea.
Nordaras-TheScryers: No, I don't think I shall. I think I have quite a few letters to write at this moment, actually. Quite a few people to catch up with, now that I am no longer off in Northrend.
Nordaras-TheScryers: But goodnight, for now, Val. I'm certain the cats will be complaining at being abandoned for, presumably, forever. I'm certain I will see you around.
Nordaras-TheScryers: Of course, Val. I always enjoy your company.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Alecea! Hello again! How have you been? Anything especially exciting happen in my absence?
Nordaras! How-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, you know how I can go on and on, I thought I would see what you'd been up to, before I talk your ears off.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, Ulduar was everything I was hoping it would be! Most everything had been cleared out years back, so it was much quieter than I expected! Were you part of that endeavor? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It does seem like there was a lot going on, in those days.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Anyway, thanks to that, I had a relatively easy time. The works of the Titans are quite breathtaking, which is saying something, considering that I don't really need to breathe.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And I find it simply fascinating that most of the races of Azeroth only exist *because* of the Old Gods, and that Curse of Flesh. The implications are... most curious.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: If you can use arcane power to create anything you wish with no effort, I suppose you may as well make things beautiful.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will be certain to write them a strongly worded letter.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will say, however, that I do not think the Old Gods are nearly as mollified as one might think they are. Or, at the very least, their cultists continue to be as bothersome as ever.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: They have long been a nuisance to my travels, of course, but rarely anything more. I think the presence of Yogg-Saron, and the fact that Ulduar has been mostly ignored these past few years-- I think they've become a bit bold.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, well. I did find myself imprisoned for a, er, brief spell. But I'm quite alright now, I assure you! No whispering in my head or any such nonsense. And I will have you know that my rescuer was-- well, he's not hard to look at.
Nordaras, but Alecea's gotten stuck on that very first part. You don't get to get off that easy. She looks immediately concerned and kind of.. half-jumps, half-leans across the table to get a good look at him to make sure he's not hurt* 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah-- Ah, I promise you, I'm quite alright, I appreciate it, but really, --
Nordaras! Are you sure you're alright? What did they want with you? What did they *do* to you? I-- I won't let this stand, if they're still up there, I-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm fine, and believe me, they've been thoroughly killed. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: They figured out fairly quickly that I was already dead, and stuck to more of the, ah, verbal and emotional type of taunting. I assume their goal was, well, I'm not really *sure* what. Probably to force me to give them information, or work for them-
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Or something.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But, really, Alecea, you know full well I can handle being told horrible things about myself. They needed far more people, and at least 20 years, if they wanted to make any meaningful impact on me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, Alecea, that was a *joke*, don't make that face with me!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm fine, I promise you. I always am.
Nordaras, that's not-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn gives Alecea's shoulder a quick squeeze.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm perfectly fine.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh! Yes, yes, I was! Bit of a stoic sort, but quite friendly. Human man-- or, mostly human, I think. I would have liked to chat more with him, but I wasn't exactly prepared to entertain, so I ended up sending him on his way.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I've sent him a letter, though, because I would like to catch up more. Find out what he was doing up there, you know, and whatnot.
Nordaras more closely. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn turns a slightly grey color, which is presumably what color his weird dead guy blood is.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He was... quite handsome. Rugged. His eyes were... sad, though. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Er, eye.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn gasps and throws a hand across his chest. He'd be clutching his pearls, if he was wearing any.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You slander me, Mrs. De'Kay!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I can be curious about him in multiple ways at once, you know. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: His name is Theon Derland. He said he was headed for Stormwind-- actually, I think he's already been there for a bit, potentially. A friend of mine said he'd already met him, although he had a.... rather different experience than I did.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He accosted me when I first arrived back!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: His name is Valineth, one of the void elves. Speaking with him is a bit like talking into a delightful, void-colored mirror. He is, like myself, incredibly curious about anything and everything.
Nordaras!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I fraternize with all sorts of people, and you know it!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: About the-- the void elf?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I have worked very hard to accumulate more friends, Alecea, and I will have you know that I've at the very least doubled the number of friends I have.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, don't guilt trip me, Alecea, I was coming to find you, I just ran into him, first! I would sincerely hope that at this point you would *trust* me a little more.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, well, one of my new, er, friends, I'm quite certain might murder me at any point, without warning, and the other might do the same, but I think he respects me enough to tell me first.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, I'm sure it will. So will being friends with humans. I hold no love for the Horde or the Alliance, Alecea, but I-- I just can't do *anything* Sylvanas tells me to. Not with how she carries on.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Not... especially. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Elivan is horribly unstable, as of late, and the Frostlord has tempered his hate of me with pity, which I am not particularly a fan of, but he at least seems to be an honorable sort. The High Shadow Priest is unpredictable.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, because having someone get scolded third-hand on your behalf is always so effective. No, no, I think we've reached a bit of an accord, he and I, although I'm never quite sure. I think his face may have frozen a bit, for how hard he is to read.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *I* was never going to murder *him*! I just-- I don't believe that he'd get over hating me so much in such a quick time, unless it was just that he started pitying me. And you know how I hate being the recipient of people's pity.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I do hope so.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I do my best!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, and before I forget-- there were some friendly Titan constructs up there, now that they aren't being driven mad by the Old Gods. I commissioned one of them for this:
Nordaras-ArgentDawn holds out a piece of framed stained glass, like that found in Ulduar. It says "Live, Laugh, Love" on it in curling, elegant script. Nordaras is clearly barely holding back a horrible grin.
Nordaras. It's awful. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn beams.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, yes. And incredibly resistant to being broken, so I've heard.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Just in case your husband got any ideas.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That does sound like him, doesn't it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I still feel bad about the gloves incident. I mean, they're certainly soft, but-- I didn't expect him to hang onto them so long!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: We're all very predictable, aren't we.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, that's their names. Don't scare them too much, Alecea.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It's possible you've seen him around Dalaran? I did refer him to the Netherlord, for guidance.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You don't need to put every person I meet through a vetting process, you know.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes. He does seem to make poor decisions, but, well, so do I.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, some of them I met on other continents where you couldn't do so.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Had you found out about me and Arthas while he was still around, I have no doubts you would have marched up to Icecrown, utterly unopposed, to tell him he had better treat me right, or else. And he probably would've gone along with it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You are a force of nature, my friend.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That I am.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, I suppose there's nothing I can do to stop you, is there.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Alright, alright. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, I won't keep you from your mission any longer, my friend.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Have you considered a piece of paper that says "I can do what I want."?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Or the paint. That might be better.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A novelty shirt, perhaps, reminding everyone of your assistance on Argus?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Perhaps all three at once, then.
Nordaras Heartbinder. 
Nordaras sending... people after me? And why-- 
Nordaras, did he invite you into his home? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: no worries! i walked right past you bc i saw smallcoffee and got distracted
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ohhhh
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: cute...
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: fuckin nordaras still hasn't done suramar
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: YEAH SAME HAT
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hello, Arithnan!
Nordaras! You're alive! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: At least somewhat.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You've been well, I hope?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You do look a little bit, ah, thin around the edges. Come, sit with me a moment.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I fear I'm fresh out, and my contacts are running dreadfully short.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That does sound a bit like I'm making fun of Danaela, doesn't it. Wordplay and gnomes, not a good combination.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I thought you may have just had a bad night.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, the death knights *can* raise undead. Most necromancers are rather unpleasant sorts. Fanatics and zealots, even in life. And, in my experience, fawning sycophants in death. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm surprised as well. You would think, after so many years without any timekeeping at all, they'd do whatever they wished.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Have you considered seeking the assistance of a frost mage, so you could keep it in the house?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A faster dragonhawk, then?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm certain a goblin would happily attach rockets to it.
Nordaras. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hmm, yes. I certainly prefer it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A robotic one, then? I've been told my problem solving abilities are quite impressive, you know. *Nordaras is makin a hell of a face and is clearly goofin'*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I can't say that's an issue I've faced myself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, there was quite a lot of snow. And a mystery I rather think you might enjoy, which I have still not managed to solve.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: The humans, dwarves, and gnomes, of course, developed when the robotic servants of the Titans were cursed by the Old Gods.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: The metallic versions are still produced by the great forges of Ulduar, and you could assume that the ability to reproduce developed later, yes?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Except, one of them had this on his corpse: *Nordaras holds out Bjarngrim Family Signet*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A family ring suggests, well, a family. And, quite unfortunately for me, the Titan's servants are really quite prudish. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Some mysteries must remain mysteries, I suppose.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes. It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You certainly saw Eonar, as clearly as any of us; perhaps she took that form so that we would understand what she was; perhaps we were made to imitate the Titans; or perhaps, well.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will not finish that thought for fear of being smited where I sit.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You would probably enjoy that. *Nordaras grins at Arithnan and gives his forearm a fond squeeze*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Their emperor had concubines! Why else?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, if they *can* have sex, why would it not be for a purpose? Where do you suppose the planets come from?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, that's fair.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Except destroy all of reality. We really put our collective feet down, as a planet, about that particular goal.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It was certainly some sort of party.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah- I should probably also mention, I actually met someone else while in Northrend.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Er, yes, I happen to have run into a group of cultists, and was, like any good tale, rescued by a rather dashing fellow.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hm? Oh, I'm-- I'm fine, Arithnan. They really could have tried a bit harder, in all honestly. They realized quickly that, being undead, most physical things they could do to me would be useless. But, as it was, they didn't find anything to taunt me with-
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: that was not either true, or something I have already heard plenty of times. Really, they were quite ineffectual.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I appreciate it, Arithnan.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, we didn't get the chance to speak much, then, but we've met up since. His name is Theon, and he's, ah, rather gruff, but in a charming sort of way. He told me he used to be a paladin, but lost his faith some time ago, and now-
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: spends his time hunting down void cultists. There was some talk of the Light that I, to be honest, didn't entirely follow. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn sighs, and looks a little more subdued for a moment.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He... He lost someone dear to him. He understands the whole... not wanting anything horribly serious thing. *He leans his head on Arithnan's shoulder.*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Not at all! And, for the record, his response to you being mentioned was something along the lines of "That's both hot, and confusing." 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I like to be up front with people, mm?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Of course I did! We talked for a very long time. I didn't want him to feel that I was somehow misleading him. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, aren't *you* a nosy one, Mister Flameleaf!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: No. It was not.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ...We were drinking as well. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Among other things.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Me, a tease? You wound me!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And I would need a piece of paper to calculate that sort of rating. I will have you know I'm a man of science, Arithnan.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah... Hmm, drop the 2, carry the 3.....Divide by pi, multiply by two.... Or is it divide by 2 and multiply by pi....
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Mm... Nine. Because apparently he scolded another a friend of mine, seemingly only because of his, ah, Void condition.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You've never asked me what I'd rate you, to be fair. This is a fundamentally flawed system.
Nordaras Very Slowly, as if to say, 'you can't just SAY something like that and not tell me the answer.'* 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I won't *stop* you, especially considering that Alecea already went and vetted him. Whilst, of couse, fervently denying that she was ensuring that he was not going to subject me to any wrongdoing.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That she does. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hmmmm. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn gives Arithnan a Very Serious look, then gives him a quick kiss.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: For science.
Nordaras, you're giving me the vapors-- *He pretends to fan himself for a moment.* 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Very interesting results. You are, at a minimum, a nine..... point six. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Such flattery.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn groans.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm well aware. He's even *blond*.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You should count yourself special, then, you know! I'm breaking a well established pattern of humans, just for you!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I think the red hair is lovely. Makes you look dashing.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It's a talent of mine.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Me too.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I should probably not keep you from poor Erileas too much longer, or else I fear he might come and hunt me down. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, I won't keep you for longer. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'll do my best, Arithnan.
Nordaras. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And yourself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Nordaras gives Arithnan's hands a quick squeeze*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'll see you around, Arithnan.
Kelahnias with a hearty hello!
Kelahnias waves at you.
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Who, me? 
Kelahnias blows you a kiss.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm not going to blow your cover or something, am I? Interrupt some crucial diplomatic meetings? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You *exaggerate.* 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You are, quite clearly, the 'handsomest and bestest' husband in all of Azeroth. 
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *That* is true. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Are you alright? How are things going? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You look exhausted. You could almost pass for an undead. 
Kelahnias frowns.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah. I can do that, just-- 
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Don't worry about it. Something nicer. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, I don't know if it's nice. It's interesting? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I met Taalle's sister? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: So did I. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: So did she! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But apparently not dead. Very not dead. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Honestly? Kind of like you. Nice. Optimistic. Played me like a damn fiddle. 
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I don't really *know.* I mean, I'm not exactly subtle and she.. said she'd been looking for me for a while. Was glad to find me in Silvermoon. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Sort of. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Sort of! I said I would ask Taalle what she thought, first. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Are you sure you want to write those tipsy, dear? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: It always is. That's why I wanted to ask her, first. Before putting them in touch. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I don't know. It might. 
Kelahnias frowns.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah, that's the problem. She's... unpredictable in her predictability. I never know how literally she's going to take something. I spent fucking forever just writing her the letter asking to talk because I was afraid she'd say no-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel reaches out to give him an affectionate and like... reassuring pat.* We haven't been in the same place. It makes things harder. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I don't know. It might. I was... against it, but she was very sad, with her droopy ears. I told you she played me like a fiddle. And I thought you'd be disappointed with me if I didn't at least make an attempt to reunite them. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Are you sure you wouldn't rather just get some rest? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Wait, have you eaten anything? It's late. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Lorsaen.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Alright, I want you to eat at least.. something. Partially because you need to eat to live. Partially because you need something to go with the alcohol. And then we're going to get an inn room and you're going to at least attempt to sleep, and if anyone-
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: tries to stop us, they'll have to go through me. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Please? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Alternatively, you can just fall asleep on the table and I'll carry you upstairs. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Does it have to be sent tonight? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Let me see the letter, first, dear. 
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: It's not you, it's just-- it's this. *He waves his hand around* This is bullshit. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I know. I'm sorry. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I love you. Sorry for leaving you alone with this. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Yeah. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Alright, alright. C'mere. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *And he absolutely does Just That. Sweeps him out of the chair like he weighs almost nothing. Gives him a lil kiss, and whisks him up the stairs so he can fuckign Sleep.* 
ordaras-ArgentDawn nearly jumps out of his skin. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, there's a face I didn't expect to see again!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Although, I suppose you wouldn't have expected to see me in Silvermoon, either.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, yes, I suppose I've made myself scarce.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah. Yes, well, I needed time to find myself, and then there new adventures to have. Did you know they found Pandaria? And the Broken Isles aren't even underwater, as we once thought. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But I digress.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, I understand. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will confess, I had thought you all fell with your queen. Tell me, is your husband-- Was he spared the wrath of the heroes of Azeroth?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah. Yes. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I was in a similar situation, finishing up a project. I would have preferred to stay, of course, but I am grateful to have been sent away, now.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That we are. Ah, shall we walk, though? I was hoping to check in on an acquaintaince of mine, but he seems to be out of town. And there are certain people here I would like to avoid.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, it does seem things have been calming down for a moment here. Although, I fear that the winds of war will begin to rise before too long.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But tell me, my friend, how have you been? Surely you have been occupied with more than just lurking around these ruins?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I cannot say that I have ever felt the same way about Silvermoon, but I will not deny being a bit disenchanted. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Where have you been off travelling? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: There's the spirit. Mostly. They were always hollow, though. Always soulless. I suppose it makes us better suited to undeath, hm?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Not the nobles here, no.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm looking at it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah- I suppose so. But, to be honest with you, Sarith, I think this place crumbles because this is what it has always truly been. Without the supports within, the facade crumbles.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: The actual city is quite well maintained, I'm told.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I mean the part of the city where people live, now. Although, I suppose most people have evacuated this portion. What makes a civilization is not the buildings, or the artifacts left behind, and I say that as an ameteur archeaologist.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: So, then what is the real problem here? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, I suppose I can't say I disagree, at least in theory.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will not fight you on that point, although I could point you to one or two people who might take those as fighting words.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I cannot say that I am a fan of the decision, but the Sin'dorei are part of the Horde now. They are not exactly famed for valuing art and architecture.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will have to address those concerns to the Sin'dorei who faced down a Titan to keep this world from being utterly destroyed. I am certain they will be quite enthusiastic about rebuilding.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Those *are* the only important people who remain, you do realize?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Nobility and bloodlines, as you pointed out, are meaningless without power. And it is the Heroes of Azeroth-- the same ones who would have happily slain both of us, had we crossed paths at the wrong time-- who have influence, nowadays.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I prefer to avoid political intrigue. I do not imagine my family has taken to their decreased power well, and I have no interest in alerting them to my continued existence.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That may be so, but I still cannot shake the feeling that my father might appear at any instant from behind a bush to lecture me. And wouldn't that be embarassing for all of us.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ugh. I bet they have tea together and pretend to cry over their poor dead children.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Sometimes I wonder if any of them ever genuinely feel bad that I ran off and got myself killed. But I doubt they have the capacity.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes. Have you met Magister Alecea De'Kay? She would do it. In a heartbeat.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I do wish you luck with that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You do have this lovely broom. Perhaps you could hijack a few constructs to your own ends?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Have you considered flinging yourself into danger for one faction or another?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will not say that it was *easy* for me to gain what positive reputation I have managed to garner, but what I have gained has been entirely due to a lack of self-preservation.
Nordaras. I.. appreciate the suggestion. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Especially with a war brewing. People will be recruiting. And the Horde, particularly under their new Warchief, is not particularly picky about who works for them.
Nordaras. He's got all sorts of random potions lying around. Most of which are apparently named-
Nordaras just wanted me to go away so I'd stop drinking red wine too quick. Apparently, you're supposed to let it "breathe", whatever the hell that means.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hello, Kel! I got your rocks.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You got-- oh, right. The rocks.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: They were very nice rocks.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Were they? They were mostly just... black. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: They were! Just a little bit of shine, you know?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: There's always more depth of color than just black, in nature, if you look closely.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I... I mean, I'm sure you're right. I don't know that I've ever looked that closely at.. rocks.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But, uh, moving on from the thrilling subject of... rocks. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: How are you? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah. Surprisingly well, actually. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh, that's-- good! You don't hear that from people very often. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: No, you really don't, do you?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Or at least, uh, not the people I know.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I, ah, I take it that not all has been sunshine and rainbows for you, then?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Uh-- 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oops bye)
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: No, not really. I mean, not for me, specifically, I guess? I don't know if I'm allowed to say.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I understand. Classified information, and all that.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Maybe? I don't know how any of it works.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I suppose I don't either, to be honest with you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I think Lorsaen is the *only* person who knows and I also think he makes it up on the spot half of the time.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It's always possible.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: How has your daughter been, though? I know how Alecea loves children-- she hasn't attempted to *completely* co-opt the child, has she?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I... think she's been alright? Sometimes it's hard to tell, she's very clever. I think she's... liking being a person again, but probably wishes that *both* of her parents would be home with any actual consistency. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: She might like Alecea more, at this point. Tabitha took *both* her cat and her dog and is spending some time with her favorite aunt *right this moment.* 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That's good to hear. Even if you're busy, you clearly love her a lot. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Alecea will do that.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But-- After her son, and Artaith being an adult woman now, I think appreciates you giving her the chance to mother someone.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I.. do. We do. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: She *does* seem to enjoy children, with her trying to take Taffy and her newfound nephew at every opportunity. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Her--? Oh. Tamaeth. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah! The one that looks like he just got back from rolling around in a pile of leaves. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, that's because he can somewhat regularly be found rolling around in leaves, I'm told.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That.. sounds about right. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He's a clever young man. About to be an older brother, too, did you hear? I suppose if you've spoken to Alecea you must've.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah, I'm... vaguely caught up on news. It sort of flocks to my household. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, well.  Has she filled you in about what I've been up to?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: No, I don't suppose. You said you were going to Northrend last time you... showed up on my doorstep and handed me a cat. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, yes, I did do that. You didn't have a cat, and I thought you might need one.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Northrend was as fascinating as ever, but I actually made a-- I met-- someone.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That's... nonspecific, but it sounds good? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Better than most things that come out of Northrend? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Quite a bit better, in fact.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Like.. what *kind* of better?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, he's actually not dead, nor has he been driven mad by Yogg-Saron, which is really something on its own.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... This man was in *Northrend?*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: W..hy?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He was hunting some smatterings of cultists that were lurking up there.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: (ill just release i think im bugged
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Interesting. And you're sure he's not crazy?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: No more than anyone else. Er, no more than anyone *normal*, at least. He hunts down cultists and minions of the old gods, when he can. Quite a nice man, all things considered.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure, just, you know, doesn't seem like the sort of behavior of someone that's, uh... stable. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I don't think anyone besides you has ever willingly gone to Northrend. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... On second thought, maybe you're perfect for each other. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It's an interesting place!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: It's a death trap! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: If he turns out to be evil, you have my permission to say "I told you so", in as obnoxious of a voice as you can muster.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I have never in my entire existence had any of the moral highground required to say 'I told you so.'
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: So don't worry too much about it. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: There's a first time for everything, but I do hope this will not be it.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm sure it's fine! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Like I said, maybe that just means you're perfect for each other. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I-- I appreciate it.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel gives him the best smile he can manage, which still leaves something to be desired, but he's doing his best.* 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Have you.... talked to Arlagos recently? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I stopped by briefly a week or so ago, when I met up with Arithnan. Why?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Just, uh.. wanted to know how he was doing. Kind of wanted to talk to him. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Wasn't sure if he hated me beyond the point of conversation, though. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He seems well. Happier than I think I have ever seen him, although it can be hard to tell. He was convinced for so long that all the blue dragons had gone mad.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I... I would not blame yourself too harshly, Kel. He joined the Ebon Blade for a specific reason, but it was never his home, never his destiny. He has always longed to return to his people, you must know this. I think he would have gone to them sooner-
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: or later.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: No, no, it's *good.* That he's found his people. That they've accepted him. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That just doesn't... Well, you know. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Now that the Legion hasn't killed us all, we have to... deal with the choices we made to stop them. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn holds his hands in front of him, nervously, before giving Kel a pat on the shoulder.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You haven't, ah, heard anything new from our-- our icy friend, have you?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Nothing of any importance. I would imagine he's considering what he'd like to have the Scourge do now that the Legion is out of the way. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Which... isn't a good thing.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: No. I suppose not. But I didn't see anything going on in the Storm Peaks, which is a good sign, at least. No pushing of boundaries, hmm?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel frowns in that 'I'm clearly very nervous about everything because I don't know what's going to happen next help' kind of way.* 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I... yeah. At least we'll have some time. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: If the Horde and Alliance wipe themselves out, though, I'm not sure where we'll stand.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: On a mass grave, I'd expect.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Haha. 
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I do hope that doesn't come to pass.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But, I suppose if that does happen, there will be precious few left to be upset about Bolvar. Although it would be a shame, after how hard we worked to stop the damn Legion.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: It sure would. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Maybe I can at least get someone to annihilate my corpse first. I'd like to avoid a repeat scenario. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: If worst comes to worst and I am somehow still standing, I will do what I can.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Thanks. 
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Lorsaen would scold me for being so depressing. We should work on that. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Cut down on all the doom and gloom.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, well, if dead people can't be gloomy together, what is the point?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You make a *great* point. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, I should probably be heading home. I don't think Theon has quite gotten the hang of feeding the cats, yet.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well, it was... nice to catch up, with all the apocalyptic nonsense aside. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You're *living* together?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That's a lot different from 'someone I met in Northrend--' 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: He's-- technically homeless? Not technically, his home still exists, but it's a bit full of plague, and--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, you have been spending too much time with Alecea-
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Listen-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Sometimes it's nice to hear gossip! Lorsaen will want to know. He needs some cheering up these days. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, I suppose it's all worth it, then. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I mean, *I* think so. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm sure I'll see you around, Kel.
Kelahnias.  Farewell!
Kelahnias waves goodbye to you.  Farewell!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn left channel.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, pardon me, gentlemen? 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, I know, very tragic. I promise to keep this brief.
Nordaras! It's good to see you! 
Nordaras an excited lil wave. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And you, as well. You both seem to be doing well, hm?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, well, who *does* expect me, really. I pride myself on making myself an unwanted guest, so it's lovely to know that I have not yet lost my touch.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I would prefer if you didn't do that, I promised I'd meet my partner for dinner, and if left unsupervised, he tends to drunkenly roam the streets, befriending rogue Eredar, and various other curious people.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And it is entirely unfair that he does such things without me. Ah, but I digress.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: What I *want* is to congratulate you two on settling down.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: There is precious little tradition that I value. Sentimentality for sentiment's sake is meaningless, if there is no heart behind it. The next best thing, of course, is practicality. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: There is a tradition, an old and oft-forgotten one, but a tradition nonetheless, of gifting new households with a cat, to ensure that their home remains free of pests. *That* is why I am here. You have a home, you need a cat. I have a great many cats.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I assume you do not want a home full of plagued rats?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That cannot be good for his health.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Bloodlord, I am trying very hard to be nice to you.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, that's the thing about being nice to people, Bloodlord, it doesn't work as well if they have to *ask* you to do it. You just do it.
Nordaras' cats away, I-- I know how much he treasures them. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I have several cats that are not fixed, for various reasons, and find myself regularly with more kittens than I quite know what to do with. And they are more than comfortable with undead, I can assure you. Particularly the ones that are undead themselves.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I'm not going to foist an animal upon you if you really despise the idea so much, although I do doubt that it is the notion of cats you so vehemently dislike, rather than myself. Perhaps I should conscribe an envoy.
Nordaras, your offer is very kind. And I, personally, would love to have one of your cats, if you are willing to part with one. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Of course, Elivan. I would not offer you a cat if I was unwilling to follow through. That would be distinctly unkind of me, wouldn't you say?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I am well accustomed to hostility when I arrive in a situation, Elivan, and in fact, I rather appreciate that it is not masked behind false civility.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Well, it's the truth! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Wonderful. I love dealing with things like adults.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And, I-- Ah. If you would indulge me a moment of surely unwanted sentiment: do be happy, you two. You deserve it. *Both* of you.
Nordaras. Truly. Especially given... my.. behavior recently. And I will treasure your gift. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, I'm certain Theon will be fine. He has all sorts of interesting friends. He's managed to befriend a void elf that he met because he was *yelling* at the poor man. It all seems to have worked out, more or less, but--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Anyway. Enjoy your lake. It is a lovely lake.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Hm? Oh, yes.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Lovely fellow. Told me that my sister is one of them, of all people.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, well, don't speak with my sister, Elivan, she is a terrible person.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes. I am the youngest of seven children. And I will assure you, Bloodlord, all of them are more intolerable than myself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I have had the good fortune of realizing that our family is full of horrible people. She has not. She is unkind, self-centered, and prone to bouts of bullying. I would not wish her on anyone.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And, additionally, for the past several years, I have enjoyed the peace of mind resulting from my horrible family believing that I am dead in Northrend somewhere. Not entirely incorrect, of course, but they do not know I came back.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I-- I do despise the woman, Bloodlord, and I would like nothing more than for you to work your charming wordsmithery on her and put her in her place. However--
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: She is still my family. I would be happy to set up a meeting in which she might realize that she is not so perfect as she claims, but I would... I would still prefer her not to end up *dead*.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Are you suggesting that you intend to turn my sister in a death knight? She's horribly ill-suited to heavy armor, I can tell you that much.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: An excellent answer.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Elivan, I will see if I can get you a meeting with one of them without revealing myself, if I can. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Eiliniya may be easier to find with free time. Valineth is busy with his not-apprenticeship.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But, Elivan, if you do speak to her, I really must warn you. She is a cruel person. She will throw barbs at you until she finds whatever it is that hurts you the most, and then she will continue to mock that thing as long as she can. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: The poor reputation of death knights truly is a mystery, isn't it.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I- I certainly hope so, Elivan. Perhaps my imagination has conspired with my memory to turn her into more of a monster than she truly is. Or perhaps she is just an intolerable person who has unquestionably accepted everything our parents believe.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I will be in touch, of course.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You are welcome. I am certain we will all be gathering once more before too long, but I do hope it may be put off as long as possible.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Not least because I do believe that Bloodlord has had more than enough of me for several months, at least.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: If I had a drink on me, I would toast that statement.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Speaking of, I really must keep track of the time. Good gracious, I've turned into some insufferable socialite, trying to say goodbye for hours but never leaving...
Nordaras. And for your cat.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: So long, and fare well.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Uh... yeah. A wonder I haven't been arrested yet. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But I'd.. rather know you're safe, honestly. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Do you ever just feel a completely overwhelming sense of dread? Because this feels like that.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: One man cannot stop a war, Lorsaen. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: It's not your fault.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: No. No we didn't. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Look* at this-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: The Dark Portal? You want to flee somewhere and Outland is your first idea-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Sorry, what-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh, you're-- you're talking about the guy we're supposed to be meeting. Delightful.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I mean, you'd, uh, need someone impressively awful when not even a death knight wants to join your war.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh, I see.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: He's just you, but awful. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I mean, Sylvanas couldn't have the *best* rogue on Azeroth, so I guess she just had to settle--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I never thought I'd feel... bad for night elves.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: What do you suppose they plan to do with the city, if they take it?
Kelahnias scowls.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: We can't-- I can't-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Well. Good to see we're in agreement.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: No better way to spend a week than a bit of treason, I suppose.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I just can't-- I can't believe the Horde agreed to this. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Did they learn *nothing* from Garrosh? Why would-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Lor'themar. Saurfang. What is their excuse? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: We'll do... something. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Hm. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Just... I don't know. If I have to drag Alliance civilians out of here with my bare hands, I'll do it.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: The night elves, they can recover. Survive and come back stronger, reclaim their city--
Kelahnias lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: How many of the Alliance forces are even *here?*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: How many night elves are in Val'sharah? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That's... that's what I'm saying. For all the Horde parades their supposed honor--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: They have very little.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Like you said. Scourge tactics.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Unfortunately I think she's too caught up in her god complex to care.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: What are the chances we try to help the Alliance and they just shoot us anyways?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... I know.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Lorsaen, I'm-- I'm much more removed from this. And you have my word that I will do what I can. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But if you'd like my opinion, which is a bit biased, I'll admit--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I... want you to stay safe. As safe as you can be. Do what you have to do until we can figure out a way to fix this.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Then I will just have to remind you this time, then. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *He sort of.. grabs Lorsaen by the shoulders and presses a kiss onto his forehead.* The sun will come up. We'll get through this. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Mhmm.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: There's some... really, really shitty irony in the planet getting stabbed by a Titan and bleeding everywhere, and we decide to weaponize it.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You know, I think I still have some Saronite laying around. Somewhere.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I should take care of that.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Ah, snowdrifts in Northrend. Home sweet home.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: They do! That's why I've still got it!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: There's no *good* way to dispose of Saronite.
Kelahnias frowns.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Lorsaen, there has never been a doubt in my mind that you are one of the good guys. There still isn't. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That's what you do best, right? Striking from the shadows. Let them think you're on their side until an opportunity arises.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I know, dear. I'm sorry. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Of course.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Lorsaen-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I love you very much. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Always.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Ah, Huntmaster! Hello.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I would, ah, imagine so, all things considered.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: If you have anything you need to get off your chest, I am always a willing listener.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes, that is one way to put it.
Nordaras right?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That's me. It's a pleasure to meet you properly. Precious little time for formal introductions whilst fighting the Legion, funnily enough.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: *Nordaras holds out his hand to shake Peaches'*
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Oh, I'm never far from whatever excitement is going on. But I have certainly eluded any attempts by the Horde at recruiting me, which have been admittedly few.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I do not believe Garrosh Hellscream liked me, Vol'jin understood I wanted nothing to do with the Horde, and, well, I do suppose our current Warchief shares Garrosh's personal distaste for me. Which suits me fine.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I... do hope so. Her judgement would certainly not be remiss in finding me unworthy of trust. That alone speaks to her judgement.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That wasn't a particularly funny thing I just said, was it. I'm very bad at being funny, I fear.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Would you care to elaborate? What is it that has you in such a mood?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That cannot have been easy for you. You have my sympathies, Huntmaster.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A brave choice. You remember that the Forsaken and the Scourge are not the same.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: oh i want the ram..... bc thats Us
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: ye thats what it says
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Huntmaster, may I ask you a question?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: You are, of course, welcome to not answer if you do not want to.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Is this worth it to you? I do not to ask to be judgemental. I do not know the answer. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Are they seperate?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It seems to me that both require the other.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Is it? Many of us-- the Warchief included-- were born long before the Horde ever set foot in Azeroth.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But you are correct. The war has never, to my knowledge, reached quite this drastic of measures.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I cannot say I know much about the worgen. I tend to avoid them, as a rule. I have no stake in this battle, but from where I sit, I see a chain of retribution.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But *why* will he not rest? I was under the impression that his homeland was invaded, which in turn, was done because the Dark Lady was nervous about your neighbors. The cycle perpetuates itself.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes. And if you trace the hatred back far enough, you find the Burning Legion.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I have no irons in this particular fire-- bad turn of phrase, I apologize-- but I often find that talking and thinking things through is quite useful.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: "Should" is subjective. We are both creatures that should not have been made. And yet, both of us fought to save this planet, did we not?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I have found that if you approach with a mug of ale and an open hand, people are more willing to talk than you might expect. Some are, ah, definitely not.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But many are.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I understand.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But at what point do you draw the line?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Again, I do not have a correct answer. I don't know. And for me to pass any judgement would be utterly hypocritical of me.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Azeroth is crowded, but still plenty large. I see no reason you should not remain in your homeland. It is *yours*, after all.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But, and perhaps this is part of the issue, it is not the Warchief's. Her homeland was, and I believe always will be, Quel'thalas. But she cannot return; she has angered and threatened the regent lord too many times for that.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn joined channel.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh there's a 2h sword from the darkshore wqs today for dks 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: if taalle/slackjaw want a replacement weapon
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ye of course! 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: And Dath'remar Sunstrider was the one to bring his people to Quel'thalas. But when he passed, his people did not collapse.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i keep doin em bc there's the Chance it'll upgrade but like
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: the rings and trinkets are Killing me
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: That does not mean you must stagnate with what time you have. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: In time, if all goes well, creatures like us will fade from this land. And that is by means a bad thing. All things end! But simply because you are dead, it does not mean you must stop living.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: success!
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I think that's a very reasonable thing.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Changing does not mean losing yourself. And... Take it from me, if who you are is tied to someone else, you will end up broken sooner or later.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Yes. Potentially for the worse.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: But you do not want to do what you are being ordered to do now?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: A tricky situation. I have another question, if I may?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Do you believe you can help the Warchief return to the leader she once was, or at least, give her some counsel?
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Then stay with her. 
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Keep trying. If she values your counsel-- which I imagine she does, to make you her Ranger-General-- you may be able to, at the very least, mitigate the damage she does.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: If she is unwilling to change for mercy's sake, find clever ways to put it. Suggest that a target isn't worth her effort, redirect her, suggest mercy in ways that seem to be simply serving her.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: It will be hard. And people may be unkind, but if I am within earshot, I will do my best to redirect their vitriol. There are things that people cannot understand.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Tiny Goldfish thelladus deserves this mini
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I hope, desperately, that I am not dooming you to follow in my footsteps. I would like to believe in the Warchief, for your sake, if for no other reason.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: oh hey
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: almost missed you there
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: because you're so short
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: LOOK at that ROGUE with her EYEPATCH
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: yeah sorry i actually put on pants today
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: I sincerely hope she is not. And I sincerely hope that you do not become another me. You seem too good a woman for that fate.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: OH HE'S A PIRATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: i'm going to cry IN REAL LIFE HE'S SO CUTE
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Do stay in touch, Huntmaster. If not with me, then with at least one of your friends. But I am always around, if you wish to talk again.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Best of luck.
Nordaras-ArgentDawn: Of course. I don't have these ears for nothing, after all.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ;__;

Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: And you're sure it's not just an elaborate plan to get us both killed?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: We're-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Stormwind?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Can't you get your friend to just... let us in, or something. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Ghh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *That gets some laughter* Oooh, let's do that--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Poison? I don't know that that's-- 
Nordaras. Fucks people up real good, but sometimes it doesn't kill 'em all the way. If the other guards are fast... Might be able to stop *some* of the killing. Without getting caught, obviously. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... I see. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Aren't you clever? 
Kelahnias creates: Blightcaller's Easy Death.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Lorsaen, I am... slightly aware of how to kill people. I will.... try my best to refrain, but.. you know how it is. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Please don't go drinking that, it'd make me sad.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yeah. Yeah, of course. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Killing *mostly* innocent people isn't exactly my idea of fun. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Do you think this is what all these... allied races thought they'd be signing up for?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You know, I've never been to Stormwind--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You'd think they'd build a statue, or something. Isn't that what people usually do?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I also think the Stormwind Guard maybe need a lesson in how to actually patrol.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Hm. No. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But that's kind of how kings work, isn't it?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: *Kel stifles a laugh* I'd be devastated if I died and *that's* what my statue looked like.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Not that I'd ever get a statue, but, y'know, hypothetically. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: -- *Hey!*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Does not! 
Kelahnias sighs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .... Who are we here for, anyways?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Saurfang's in the Stockades?!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You know, I'm not sure sharpshooters are the best troops to station in a prison with tight corners and short hallways--
Kelahnias nods at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn grabs Lorsaen's hand as he passes and gives it a quick squeeze before setting off.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Honestly, I expected something a little nicer for the Stormwind prison, of all things.
Kelahnias laughs.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh, good. Stealth.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I think they know we're here.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Good, yes. Good *at?* No.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh, that's the king--
Kelahnias.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: He's bigger than when I last saw him! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But maybe it's the armor.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I don't know how you could forget. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Really, your greatest feat. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Ah, hm. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Y'know this isn't ideal--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Assuming the Worgen don't bleed all over it.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: How many did you *write?*
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oh that's not good.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm so glad Genn Greymane is too old to run--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I don't think she speaks Thalassian.
Kelahnias laughs at you.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You know, this is about what I expected.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... Oh, fuck, it sure is.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Is.. it?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm... sure it'll be fine.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Stormwind's mostly stone, right? Mostly.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: For once?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Really I think it would always suck to be Nathanos--
Kelahnias laughs.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: But she's not doing that right now, is she? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: All Sylvanas cares about is usefulness, and I think he knows it.
Kelahnias shrugs.  Who knows?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: ... They're a little intense, huh.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Eugh. It's humid here.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Maybe she'll teach you!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm going to melt.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Pfft.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: (HUK SELLS BRACELETS_
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Some of-- 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You can't be serious.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'd look like a fool!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm too pale! And dead!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Really, if anybody should be putting that on, it should be you--
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: There's only half of it there! It can't weigh anything!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You-- what?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Lorsaen. Dear. Love. Honey. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Never change.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Look at that cute tunic one of the guards has on! Get one of those!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: That warm, hm?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You could hold my hand, or something. Try and make yourself less.... warm. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Not that I'm complaining. You look great. Just don't get stabbed by anything.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You're welcome to do that, dear. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Hm?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: It's a triangle.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Interesting. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: You know who would love this?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Exactly what I was thinking! 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Hm, maybe. But I don't know that I want her just... roaming, you know? 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: The Zandalari aren't known for their friendliness. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I'm sure she'd love to come with us. 
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Look at that child and tell me she wouldn't love a dinosaur.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Yes, exactly!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Also probably true.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: .. There's a thought!
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: I mean, she sort of owes us.
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Oculeth? The portal guy?
Kelahnias-ArgentDawn: Probably.
